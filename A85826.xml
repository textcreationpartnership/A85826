         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">§. 2.

            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. We fear the great and living God, who hath ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not ſwear by my Name falſly, neither ſhalt thou profane the Name of thy God:</hi> Having therefore <hi>at the Command of Lords and Commons Aſſembled in-Parliament,</hi> Anno 1643, 1644. <hi>lift up our hands unto God,</hi> and ſworn; <hi>that we would endeavour the extirpation of Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy, that is, the Government of the Church by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, and other Officers depending upon that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi> we cannot go back, either by endeavouring to <hi>build what we have destroyed,</hi> or by any poſitive owning of any ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Authority; though we acknowledge our ſelves obliged by all ſacred Bands, to be actively obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient both to the <hi>King as Supream,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> in all things where he <hi>who is higher than the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> hath not by his Command ſuperſeded ſuch our <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and where the ſalvation of our immortal ſouls is not hazarded: And (which God forbid) if any thing of that nature (ſhould by any miſtake) be commanded by you, we humbly acknowledge it our duty (without any thoughts of rebelling againſt you) to exerciſe our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> in ſuffering what ſhall be impoſed upon us, committing the cauſe of our ſouls to him who <hi>judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. For our Conſciences in this thing <hi>(moſt noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators!)</hi> are we this day called in queſtion, and judged for what we do in <hi>obedience</hi> (as we humbly conceive) to
<pb facs="tcp:114690:4"/> the holy Law of God: For this <hi>Conſcience ſake</hi> in reference to our Oath, are we accuſed by our Brethren.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Out of the Conſcience of that Oath it was, that many of your ſelves have ſuffered and done many things, both in oppoſition to the late uſurpations of Government, and for the reſtoring of his moſt Sacred <hi>Majeſty;</hi> you have not alſo wanted Companions in your Sufferings, from our inferior Orbe, where many have been found, who that they might keep their ſouls clear from ſo high a guilt, as that of <hi>Perjury,</hi> have not only been content, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves advantages of preferment, but to ſuffer the loſs of <hi>Life, Livelihood, Liberty,</hi> to be <hi>Exiles</hi> in a ſtrange Land, and to forſake whatſoever hath been dear to them.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. We are now told (Right <hi>Honourable</hi>) that all your and our Sufferings upon this account were <hi>in vain,</hi> for the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> which we ſo reverence, was <hi>ab initio</hi> null and void; That the matter of it was <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>unlawful, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſchiſmatical,</hi> That <hi>the power impoſing it, was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the deſign of it, Rebellion and Faction, that it was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Oath,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="8">§. 8. Yet becauſe not only our private <hi>Honour,</hi> but the <hi>Honour</hi> alſo of the <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> and Nation are (as we humbly conceive) deeply concerned, in our vindication as to this Point, we have thought it our duty, to lay at your <hi>Honours</hi> feet a juſt <hi>Apology</hi> for our ſelves, and for the <hi>Oath</hi> which at the command of ſome of your <hi>Honours,</hi> we

            <p n="9">§. 9. As to our concernment (moſt noble Patriots) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom <hi>the ends of the time of Reformation</hi> are come, we are not ſo much concerned now to enquire, <hi>whether the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and taking of that Covenant, at firſt, were lawfull yea or no?</hi> Our Queſtion is, <hi>Whether we having taken it, are not now bound to keep it?</hi> The moſt therefore of Dr. <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s and the <hi>Oxford Reaſons</hi> againſt the Covenant, ſignifie nothing to our preſent caſe.

            <p n="10">§. 10. It is agreed by the eminently Learned and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> and all Caſuiſts, That an Oath may be unlawful <hi>reſpectu rei juratae,</hi>

            <p n="17">§. 17.

            <p n="19">§. 19. The Princes of the greateſt <hi>Congregation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (Right Honourable) i. e.</hi> The Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, were thoſe who ſware, and who engaged us to ſwear. If our Adverſaries may be believed, the <hi>deſign of the Oath was to engage the Scots in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments quarrel</hi> (His Majeſty then living, as we ſaid before, had more charitable thoughts) ſure it is, that it was a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtipulation between the <hi>Scots</hi> and us. <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſay, that my <hi>Oath doth not bind my Heir</hi> (which is true in ſome caſes) but they as generally agree the <hi>real obligation of an Oath, as to the perſon to whom we ſwear for their advantages.</hi> We are ſure, the <hi>Jews</hi> which were puniſhed with three years Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, were none of thoſe who had perſonally ſworn to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> in the time of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> yet God revengeth their Breach of their Fathers Oath upon them. It may be worthy of your Honours conſideration, whether the Obligation contracted by Oath, by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, 1643, 1644. do not bind the Noble <hi>Lords</hi> with your ſelves, who this day make up thoſe <hi>Honourable Aſſemblies,</hi> though perſonally you never were engaged in it.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. However, we know and believe, that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours will be ſo jealous for the Glorious Name of God, ſo tender of the Souls of the People in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions engaged in that Sacred Bond, and ſo afraid of the
<pb facs="tcp:114690:8"/> wrath of God revealed in his Word, and by his Providence, againſt thoſe who have made others Sufferers for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, and ſo careful for the Honour of the Nation, that you will not by any Act of yours, contribute to any of theſe ends, which will all be the certain conſequents of the violation of that Sacred Oath.</p>
            <p n="21">§. 21. For as it cannot be imagined, but that your <hi>Honours</hi> Authority, eſtabliſhing any thing contrary to that Oath, will be a temptation to many, to break that ſacred Bond; ſo it can as little be thought, but that there will be many thouſands in <hi>England,</hi> who will believe that nothing can diſcharge their Conſciences from the Obligation of the Oath of God which is upon them, and therefore will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to go chearfully into the Priſons which ſhall be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, and to ſuffer any thing, rather than to ſin againſt the Lord by ſuch a preſumptuous tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p n="22">§. 22. Beſides this, we moſt humbly beſeech your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> to conſider, whether the things endeavoured to be reſtored, have upon former experience proved, or may probably be judged like to prove of ſuch advantage, either to the civil or religious intereſts of <hi>England,</hi> as may be fit to be laid in the Ballance with the laying aſide ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds (if not thouſands) of Godly Miniſters, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and undoing of ſo many peaceable and godly people as will be laid a ſide, and made ſufferers by the reſtoring of things in the Church to their formes ſtate, after an Oath taken to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="23">§. 23. Many of your <hi>Honours,</hi> we know have not yet forgotten, how many hard things were ſuffered in former times, by many Godly people in this Nation; becauſe in Conſcience they could not ſubmit to theſe things; how many of the <hi>Kings</hi> Subjects were (to the weakning of the Nation) driven into Forreign Lands, to the undoing of themſelves and their Families; how by this means divers Myſteries of Trades of manufacture (in which the wealth
<pb facs="tcp:114690:9"/> of this Nation much lay) were communicated to other People; all which things formerly were judged worthy of <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="24">§. 24. We humbly beſeech your <hi>Honours</hi> to conſider, whether the ſame perſons, in moſt places of <hi>England,</hi> be not again endeavouring to be poſſeſſed (if they be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inveſted) with the ſame power, and whether (after twenty years ſuffering) it be probably to be conceived, that they are leſs full of rage,<note place="margin">Let enquiry be made at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Cambridge Peterborough,</hi> &amp;c.</note> than formerly: And if any hath ſo much Charity, as to think, that their ſufferings have taught them more moderation, we deſire your <hi>Honours</hi> would enquire, what <hi>ſpecimens</hi> they have any where already given of it. This we humbly move to your <hi>Honours,</hi> that you may repreſent it to his Majeſty, whoſe Royal <hi>Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was ſuch a Zealous Defender of the free Grace of God, againſt <hi>Arminians,</hi> and who himſelf hath declared ſuch a Zeal againſt <hi>vitious, prophane and debauched perſons,</hi> that we cannot but believe him not truly informed; either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Principles or converſations of divers perſons, to whom advantages are given againſt their Brethren.</p>
            <p n="25">§. 25. We are not <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> againſt the <hi>uſe of an unimpoſed Lyturgy,</hi> nor againſt <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy;</hi> we can ſubmit to both, we do not think the Covenant was intended againſt either of theſe: But we are againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. We believe, that in the Primitive Church there might be <hi>Epiſcopus praeſes;</hi> a Grave Miniſter, Preſident over his Brethren, living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Circuit proportionate to his Ability for inſpection, and that without him, nothing was ordinarily done, in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Juriſdiction: But that he alone could do any thing in either, we utterly deny. We are ſure, that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, there was no <hi>Archbiſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons.</hi> We are againſt thoſe <hi>Forms of Worſhip,</hi> contained in the <hi>Service-Book, ordinary to be had;</hi> We believe they are
<pb facs="tcp:114690:9"/> not eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of the Land (as we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in a Book for that purpoſe publiſhed) made evident to your <hi>Honours.</hi> We are ſure that we have lifted up our hands to God, that we will endeavour a Reformation in that Point: We know that they are offenſive in an high degree, to the generality of godly and ſober men, that there are many things in thoſe Books not to be juſtified in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. We are not againſt the 39 Articles, which is uſually called the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> We are ready to ſubſcribe all of them, ſo far as they concern mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But we are againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> againſt which not only King <hi>James,</hi> (of Glorious Memory) gave an open teſtimony, but the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo heretofore openly declared: And in regard the Patrons of thoſe Points, take advantage of ſome doubtful terms in thoſe Articles, as patronizing thoſe their Tenets (though the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their deteſtation of thoſe Points) We could heartily wiſh a further <hi>explanation</hi> of them: We are againſt <hi>moral and ſignificant Ceremonies,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Surplice, the Croſs in Baptiſm, Bowing at the Name of Jeſus, Cringing to Altars,</hi> &amp;c. We believe that theſe things are not only <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and <hi>unprofitable (things that periſh with the uſing</hi>) but alſo unlawful and againſt the purity and <hi>ſimplicity of Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and ſuch, againſt which we are highly engaged by the Oath of God which we have taken.</p>
            <p n="26">§. 26. We humbly beſeech your <hi>Honours,</hi> to compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate the many thouſands of Souls in <hi>England,</hi> who muſt be Sufferers, to the undoing of their Perſons, their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> if theſe things be reſtored again amongſt us. We acknowledge our ſelves obliged (if theſe things be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your Act) paſſively to obey, and rather to ſeek our bread in a <hi>howling wilderneſs,</hi> than any waies to contribute to the diſturbance of civil Authority. <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> are our only weapons. But oh! let not the Cry of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
<pb facs="tcp:114690:10"/> be againſt the <hi>Parliament of England;</hi> becauſe God hath ſaid he will <hi>hear their cry, and help them.</hi> If our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> think that no Government may be ſet up in the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> but the ancient Form, and that the whole Nation is not concerned in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> for which we plead, and themſelves be not perſonally engaged in it; let them enjoy their humors: But oh! Let them not by your <hi>Honours,</hi> be cloathed with power to <hi>ſuſpend, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, excommunicate, deprive godly Miniſters</hi> and people, (who are faithful Subjects to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and pray daily for him, and for your Honours) becauſe they cannot comply with them in theſe things, expreſly contrary to the Oath of the Lord which is upon them.</p>
            <p n="27">§. 27. We here lay at your <hi>Honours feet</hi> our Anſwers to their pitiful Pleas againſt us, by which they would cajole us into Perjury. If our <hi>Brethren</hi> have any more <hi>ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let them bring them forth;</hi> only let us ſay with Dr. <hi>Featly, Audiamus non phalerata ſed fortia,</hi> we have had enough gay words.

            <p n="28">§. 28.

What loſs would his Sacred Majeſty have, by pleaſing all the more ſober part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by a new unimpoſed Form of Prayer, void of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? by multiplying the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they may be able to do their work? by reſtraining them from their <hi>ſole Juriſdiction</hi> not to be juſtified, by any <hi>Scripture, Reaſon, Antiquity,</hi> or the example of any Reformed Church?</p>
            <p n="28">§. 28.

                  <p>The ſeveral Forms of verbal Obligations ſimple and mixt. Of a Promiſe, an Oath, a Vow, a Covenant, the diſtinct Nature of each. The Covenant proved to be a Compound of all, and therefore highly obligatory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. BEſides the natural ties of every ſoul unto God, by which (as a Creature) it is bound in a duty of univerſal homage to its <hi>Creator,</hi> as it is directed by the light of Nature, or <hi>Revelation</hi> in Scripture, and the natural obligation, of <hi>Brotherly love,</hi> by which a man is indebted to his Neighbour, we are told by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 30.2. that we may either inhance this hereditary debt, or contract a new one, to God, or men, by the words of our lips, <hi>binding our Souls in a bond,</hi> which (without <hi>prophaning</hi> our ſelves) we cannot violate. Which Bond, according to the different ſeal affixed to it, or the different Parties to whom it is delivered as our <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Deed,</hi> according to the various matter, Form, or circumſtances of it, hath obtained ſeveral names, and hath more or leſs obliging vertue.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. There are 4 more noted Terms uſed in Scripture (and by Divines interpreting Scripture) expreſſive of ſuch Obligations: A <hi>Promiſe,</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> a <hi>Vow,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant.</hi> A Promiſe (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) is <hi>a rational Act of a man,</hi>

                  <hi>by which he declareth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth his purpoſes to another;</hi> as a Superiour by his precept ordereth others, as to what he would have them do for him: So by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Superiour, inferiour or equal ordereth himſelf, as to what <hi>he will do for others.</hi> This when made freely, is by <hi>Criticks</hi> called, <hi>pollicitatio:</hi> when at the importunity of another, <hi>promiſſio;</hi> either way, <hi>lex privata,</hi> it becometh a private law, obliging the ſoul morally vertuous, or religiouſly good, to a ſtrict performance.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. An Oath is a religious Act <hi>ubi Deus teſtis invocatur;</hi> where for further ſecurity to others of what we believe, or have done or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to do, God is called in for a witneſs; which ought not to be, but in weighty matters, and in doubtful matters: But all the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture actions of men, being ſuch as are ſubjected to various accidents and contingencies, through the mutability of our minds, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs

                  <hi>That an Oath doth add to a promiſe a ſpecial obligation. Filiucius,</hi> and others make it an Article of our Creed, by telling us, that it is <hi>de fide</hi> to believe that it doth ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. A Vow (ſaith <hi>Richardus) eſt propoſiti ſupererogativè boni promiſſio Deo facta propter bonum finem, ex deliberatione firmata.</hi> By which deſcription, nothing neceſſary by the neceſſity of a Divine Precept can be the proper matter of a Vow; no it muſt (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him) be <hi>ſupererogativè bonum,</hi> ſome good thing which God hath not required at our hands; but we (not well underſtanding what good thing can be aſſigned, which falleth under no Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) do rather cloſe with their more ordinary and juſtifiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, who tell us, <hi>It is a promiſe made to God:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thus it differs from a promiſe, which may be made to men, and that as to the things of this world: A Vow can only be made to God, and that <hi>in rebus Dei,</hi> in the things of God. Not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves with the niceties of the deſcription of it, certain it is that the Obligation reſulting from it is great. <hi>Aquinas, Sayrus, Filiucius, Layman</hi> and others, determine the obligation of a <hi>Vow,</hi> to exceed that of an <hi>Oath;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aq. <hi>22</hi> ae q. <hi>89.</hi> art <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Oath ariſeth only from that <hi>reverence</hi> which we owe to the <hi>Sacred Name of God:</hi> But the obligation of a <hi>Vow</hi> ariſeth from that <hi>fealty</hi> which we owe to God, the violation of which is alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with irreverence. Not to diſpute the ſtrength of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, we think this (which ſome Caſuiſts have alſo hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) may be ſuperadded: That although in every Vow there be not a formal invocation of God (God being the proper <hi>correlate,</hi> and as it were, a Party to every <hi>Vow,</hi> and therefore not formally to be invoked for the conteſtation of it) yet there is in every Vow an implicit calling God to witneſs; ſo that certainly the obligation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114690:17"/> ariſing from a <hi>Vow</hi> is not beneath that of an <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. A <hi>Covenant</hi> (ſtrictly taken) is <hi>a mutual ſtipulation of two or more parties,</hi> and in that lies its ſpecifick difference, both from a naked promiſe, and from an Oath and a Vow; all which maybe made by ſingle perſons: But the nature of a Covenant is ſuch, as requireth at leaſt two parties mutually ingaging each to other. This obligation may be either contracted with <hi>God,</hi> or with our <hi>neighbour,</hi> and that concerning any kind of things, from whence are the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of <hi>Covenants</hi> treated on by <hi>Civilians</hi> and <hi>Politicians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we ſhall ſpeak nothing in this place. The <hi>Jews</hi> contracted a formal Covenant with God, when upon the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they ſaid, whatſoever the Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we will do; whence it is (as we conceive) that they are ſo often charged in holy Writ, with <hi>breaking Covenant;</hi> in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Divine Law. And God having given us in his Word, an everlaſting Rule of righteouſneſs, to the obedience of which we are engaged, by immutable promiſes (although God hath left off to ſpeak from Heaven to us) yet we are ſtill left in a capacity to make formal <hi>Covenants with God,</hi> which we do as often as we by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſes engage our ſelves to the ſtricter obſervance of the Divine Law in whole or in part. The obligatory vertue of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (ſeparated from the additional force of an Oath, by which it may be alſo further confirmed) ſeems to be encreaſed from the mutual <hi>conſideration,</hi> upon which it is neceſſary that each part of a Covenant ſhould be entred; which makes every Covenanter to have a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and adds an obligation from juſtice to a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; ſo that as he who breaks a naked promiſe, ſins againſt his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity;</hi> and he who violates his <hi>Oath,</hi> highly ſins againſt that reverence which he owes to the ſacred name of God; ſo he that breaks a Covenant, ſinneth againſt <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which every man is obliged to maintain, as that which joynteth all humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and keepeth the world in order.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Now beſides theſe ſimple bonds, which ſhould be ſufficient to hold vertuous and religious men, there may be compounded Formes, in which there may be a mixture of two or three or all of theſe: And reaſon will eaſily teach us, that if any of theſe ſingle cords, be ſufficient to hold a ſoul which hath any value for <hi>Truth,</hi> any <hi>Reverence for the Name of God,</hi> or profeſſeth any fealty to him, or in whom any love of common juſtice may be found, and who hath not, without regard either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114690:18"/> of <hi>Religion</hi> or moral Honeſty, taken up a reſolution, to break all ſacred bonds aſunder, and caſt all cords behind his back: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when two, three, or all of theſe are twiſted into one cord, they muſt be ſtronger than <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſeven green withs, and like <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> threefold cord which cannot eaſily be broken.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And if we miſtake not, ſuch is the nature of this ſacred <hi>Cord</hi> (the ſtrength of which we are trying) The ſtyle of the whole is promiſſory, and argues all the force of a promiſe in it: The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to it concluding thus,—<hi>With our hands lifted up to the moſt High God, we do ſwear;</hi> together with that Clauſe in the laſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph— <hi>And this Covenant we make in the preſence of Almighty God the ſearcher of all hearts,</hi> ſufficiently prove it to be an Oath, and to have in it all the vertue of that ſacred Obligation: If a Vow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common notion of it) be <hi>ſponſio facta Deo in rebus Dei,</hi> a promiſe made unto God in the things of God, who ſo reads the firſt ſecond or laſt Paragraphs, muſt certainly ſee much of a Vow in it: And if the impoſing of it under penalty, delivers any that have taken it, from the obligation of a <hi>Vow</hi> (either through want of <hi>freedom</hi> or <hi>deliberation</hi>) yet certainly this will not excuſe the firſt Contrivers, and Compoſers. <hi>The Lords and Commons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament</hi> at that time, did not only make a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and confirm it with an <hi>Oath,</hi> but vowed in it a Vow to the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſtand concerned to do according to the <hi>Vow which they have vowed.</hi> That it is a <hi>Covenant,</hi> both with <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> is ſo evident, that he who runs may read it. So far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it any promiſe made on our part, for the doing of thoſe things which the Word of God revealeth to be his will concerning us, that we ſhould do, either relating to the Reformation of the Church, or our own perſonal Reformation, or for the declining of what is contrary thereunto (of which nature is much both in the firſt, ſecond and laſt Paragraphs of it) it is unqueſtionably a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</hi> Beſides this, The <hi>King, Parliament,</hi> and <hi>People of the Three-Nations,</hi> by it mutually covenant each with other, for the performance of thoſe things which reſpect them in their ſeveral ſtations, either reſpecting Reformation, or the Preſervation of each others mutual Rights. The King covenanted with his People, that he will <hi>reform Religion,</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches: That he will preſerve the Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Church of Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. In this alſo the <hi>Parliament</hi> joynes

Throughout the whole, there is a mutual ſtipulation of the People of the Three Nations each with other.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. So that if there be any vertue in a promiſe, from the <hi>truth of men</hi> by it laid to pawn, and not to be redeemed without a juſt fulfilling of the thing promiſed: If any Religion in an <hi>Oath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Reverence</hi> we owe to the Sacred Name of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> If any Obligation reſulteth from a <hi>Vow,</hi> becauſe of the Fealty which we owe unto God before, and above all others: If finally a man be obliged to keep his Covenant, from the conſideration ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>juſtice;</hi> it all contributeth to the ſtrength of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bond, by which all the Souls that have taken it in the Three Nations, are this day bound to the Almighty, and each to other.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. And certainly for thoſe who are not ſo immediatly concern'd, but can glory, that either they were not of age, or that they were only ſtanders by, when others thus obliged themſelves; if there be any Ingenuity in them, any Reverence of God, any Brotherly Love, or any good will to the Land of their Nativity, they will be obliged to be jealous for their Brethren (who have thus bound themſelves) with a godly jealouſie, leſt whiles for ſuch a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous tranſgreſſion, as the violation of this ſacred Bond muſt be, the wrath of the Lord ſhall burn up the dwellings of Tranſgreſſors, their contiguity of habitation expoſe them to the danger in which it is ordinary for the Juſtice of a Righteous God to involve the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſinners: To ſay nothing of their concernment, in the prophaning of the Lords Name, whoſe honour is equally impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Neighbours ſins, as by our own: If they be <hi>Lots,</hi> their righteous ſoules will be vexed with the evil converſation of their Neighbours: If <hi>Davids, their eyes will run down with rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> becauſe others <hi>keep not Gods Laws.</hi> Which makes the bold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of ſome not only to grate upon our ears, but to pierce our hearts, whilſt we hear them not only content to diſpenſe with their own Engagements, but reviling others, whoſe Conſciences cannot allow them that Latitude, or who take themſelves concerned, to warn the ſouls committed to their charge, to beware of ſo great a ſin

               </argument>
               <p>FRom what hath been already ſaid, 'tis not hard to conclude, That a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> a <hi>Vow,</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> or any <hi>form of Obligation,</hi> compounded of two or more of theſe, engaging us to any future performance, addeth to any praevious Obligation, which might before be upon us from the Law of Nature, or from the Law of Gods eternal Righteouſneſs: For whereas the matter of theſe may be either <hi>impoſſible</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> (in which caſes the obligations are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void, and we are only bound to repentance) Or 2. <hi>Indefinite</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> (in which caſe, the obligation muſt be adjudged and determined, when the true nature of the matter appeareth to us.)

Certain it is, that where the thing which we have promiſed, ſworn, vowed or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for, is ſuch as is in our own power: Our Promiſe, Vow, Oath or Covenant, createth in us an obligation, to that part which we have ſo bound our ſelves for, and depriveth us of our former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in it, and hence an Oath or <hi>Vow</hi> is called by Divines <hi>lex pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata,</hi> a By-law which man hath made unto himſelf.

               <argument>
                  <p>The further Obligatory Vertue of the Covenant argued, from the Solemnities of it, arguing the Violation deliberate, and infamous.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough (after thus much ſaid) it might be needleſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if there be any other auxiliary ſtrength to be added, in plea for it, yet we cannot but take notice of that known Maxim which we find in <hi>Sayrus,</hi> and other Caſuiſts;<note place="margin">Sayri <hi>Clavis Reg. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. §. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Quanto creſcunt ſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitates, tanto majus eſt juramentum,</hi> by how much more ſolemn an oath, by ſo much the greater is the obligation of it. <hi>Sayrus</hi> is ſo confident of the truth of it, that he aſſerteth this, That an <hi>Oath made by the Creature, if ſolemnly taken, is more obligatory than an Oath made by the Creator, without ſuch a ſolemnity:</hi> and determineth him only <hi>infamouſly perjured,</hi> who violateth a ſolemn Oath. But we think Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> hath hit the mark, in telling us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Sanderſon <hi>prael.</hi> 5. §. 12.</note> that the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi> of an Oath contributeth nothing to the intrinſick value and Obligation of it, but accidentally contributeth to its vertue, as it importeth <hi>deliberation</hi> in thoſe that took it; and expoſeth the <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi> to a greater <hi>Scandal:</hi> The truth of which is obvious enough to every vulgar capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. But if the <hi>ſolemnity</hi> of the Act, can any waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to a Sacred Bond, certainly the Covenant (for which we are pleading) is as much advantaged as is imaginable for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114690:20"/> any thing of that nature. It was firſt ſolemnly debated, branch by branch, and phraſe by phraſe, in the greateſt <hi>Convention</hi> of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by a <hi>Reverend Aſſembly</hi> of Divines, then taken in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe,</hi> and in that <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> by <hi>hands lifted up to the moſt High God,</hi> after this, <hi>Printed,</hi> by their Order, and with their Names ſubſcribed to it. After this, by them ordered to be taken by all grand Officers of State, and by all Maſters and Fellowes of Colledges, by all Miniſters, and by all ſuch as ſhould enter into the Miniſtry, and by the people in all Congregations: To which purpoſe it is advantaged by an Exhortation to the taking of it, printed with it by Order of the ſaid <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> After this, Miniſters are deſigned by the Countrey-Committees, to give it to the ſeveral Congregations (having firſt preached a Sermon to quicken people to the taking of it) It was then taken both by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, with hands <hi>lifted up to the moſt High God,</hi> in the face of the <hi>publick Congregation.</hi> After this, ordered to be hung up in Churches, and at certain times to be renewed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. So that certainly, whether we conſider the <hi>complex nature of the Covenant in it ſelf,</hi> having in it ſome ingredients of all ſacred-Bonds, or the Circumſtances which attended the taking of it, never was there an higher Obligation laid upon a Nation owning God, never a ſtronger Bond laid upon Chriſtian Souls. <hi>Poeni foedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragi</hi> of old grew into a Proverb; Let not <hi>Englands</hi> Coat be ſo ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for certainly it is not capable of a greater blot, than that of a falſe and <hi>Covenant-breaking Nation.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Rules in general concerning the Interpretation of Oaths: Theſe applied to the Covenant, and the true ſence of it evinced from them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may ſeem very unreaſonable after ſixteen years digeſtion of the Covenant, to fetch it back into our mouths, that we may make a judgment of the true taſt of it, which the wiſe man foreſaw, when he told us it was a ſnare <hi>after vowes to make enquiry:</hi> The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours of our ſtomacks (in this time) may have much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it or us from what at firſt we ſhould have (poſſibly) pronounced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114690:20"/> concerning it. And the more unreaſonable, becauſe the proper Interpreters of it are ceaſed; The <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> who firſt impoſed it (if the Rule be good, <hi>ejuſdem eſt interpretari ac condere</hi>) yet becauſe there are not a few, who will not believe it ſo edged a tool, but that it may be played withal, and who apply to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Rabbinical Fable of <hi>Manna,</hi> which they ſay had a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it which ſured every Pallat, we cannot reaſonably proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we have enquired, whether indeed we hugged a <hi>Proteus,</hi> when we rejoyced in that ſacred Oath, or whether this be not an ill report, without any juſt cauſe brought up upon a good action, that by it, the Adverſaries of Reformation, might either diſcharge others from its obſervance (under pretence of its uncertain ſound) or pleaſe themſelves with a dream at leaſt, that they ſhall be ſecure in the moſt preſumptuous violation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Only in regard that <hi>Obligatio juramenti eſt oneroſa,</hi> the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an Oath (if any at all) is exceeding heavy, though the luxuriant vanity of ſome mens wits, and the ſtrong predominancy of luſt in others, conſtrain us to an enquiry, yet we ſhall ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make it exceeding ſtrictly and narrowly, being under this aſſurance; That every ſoul which hath taken it, is highly engaged either to the ſevereſt obſervance of it, or to a more than ordinary humiliation for his prophane attempt to mock that God ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who hath told us that <hi>he cannot be mocked.</hi> Nor are we concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enquire the juſt ſenſe of every Branch in the Covenant, but only of the Second Article, in which is contained the chiefeſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our preſent Debate.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. It is true, <hi>Molina, Tabiena, Sylveſter, Layman,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus,</hi> and ſome others (with what conſiſtency to themſelves, in other places of their Writings may be judged by comparing <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That none is further bound by an Oath or Vow, further than he would have obliged himſelf, if he had either foreſeen or obſerved the neceſſary, or contingent, iſſue of it:</hi> By which means they ſet up a Chancery in every particular ſoul, to relieve it from the rigour of that <hi>[Lex pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata]</hi> private Law of an Oath. But <hi>Cajetan, Lopez, Sotus,</hi> and others, reaſonably oppoſe this licentious Principle, as that which laies a Foundation, to enervate all ſacred and civil Obligations— <hi>quia ſaepe contingunt aliqua quae ſi fuiſſent praeviſa contractus non celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur, nec ad eum eventum contrahentes ſe obligâſſent.</hi> Hence <hi>Sanches</hi> limits that Rule, <hi>[That what would at firſt have hindred our obliging of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114690:21"/> our ſelves by an Oath or Vow, had it been foreknown, or had it firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, will alſo diſcharge us (when known, or come to paſſe) from our Obligation to the performance of it]</hi> To thoſe things only which (had they been firſt known) had made the entring into ſuch ſacred bond unlawful,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>ratione materiae, inhabilis ad producendam obligationem,</hi> in regard of the matter being ſuch to which an obligation could not be created. <hi>Filiucius</hi> tels us that an Oath muſt be interpreted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the act to which it is annexed; <hi>becauſe he who ſweareth, intendeth to ſwear only that which he promiſeth, in the ſame manner and under the ſame conditions as he promiſeth.</hi> We much doubt the truth of this (which dependeth upon another queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an oath may not bind a man beyond his intention</hi> when he ſwears) Undoubtedly an Oath may oblige a man beyond his private intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in this we think all Proteſtant Caſuiſts agree. That other Rule therefore given by Caſuiſts, is better, <hi>Juramenti obligatio eſt ſtrictè Juris.</hi> That an Oath muſt be ſtrictly interpreted, <hi>quoad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria &amp; verba permiſerint;</hi> as ſtrictly as the matter and words will bear; and thus <hi>Filiucius</hi> agrees at laſt, and <hi>Suarez</hi> with him. And it were a woful ſhame for us Chriſtians to diſpute this, when <hi>Tully</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Cicero <hi>de Offic.</hi> lib. 3.</note> that an Oath muſt be kept in that ſenſe—<hi>ſicut ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis concipitur more noſtro.</hi> Yet Divines here ordinarily diſtinguiſh, betwixt <hi>ſpontaneous, arbitrary Oaths,</hi> and ſuch as are by others <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> upon us: and concerning each, determine thus: 1. <hi>That ſuch Oaths as we voluntarily take, muſt be interpreted (ex ipſius jurantis mente)</hi> by our ſelves, beſt Judges of our own ſenſe. 2. <hi>But ſuch as are impoſed by others, muſt be by us interpreted, according to the ſenſe of thoſe that impoſed them upon us.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth, and quoteth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the caſe, <hi>Ep.</hi> 224, 225. He adds this irrefragable reaſon; <hi>Becauſe the end of impoſing Oaths upon others, is to create or beget to the Impoſers, an aſſurance from him or thoſe that take them, that they will fulfil what they ſwear, or promiſe, which aſſurance none can have who impoſeth an Oath upon another, if he that takes the Oath, have a Latitude of interpretation left unto him, with a liberty to abound in his own ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Yet both theſe rules muſt be limited; ſo, that neither our <hi>private ſenſe</hi> of our Spontaneous Oathes, nor yet the <hi>ſenſe of thoſe that impoſe Oathes upon others,</hi> muſt be other then will comport with the juſt ſignification of the <hi>words</hi> or <hi>phraſes</hi> in the <hi>Oath, Vow,</hi> or <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for this were to deſtroy the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> neceſſary to every Oath, and indeed not to <hi>interpret,</hi> but to coin an Oath, or <hi>new Obligation.</hi>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114690:21"/>§. 5. We muſt conclude then, That the <hi>ſenſe of the Covenant</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the will of others impoſed upon us for their ſecurity, that we would do as we there promiſed) <hi>muſt be no other then what</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with the ſignificancy of the words in which it was conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>was the ſenſe of the Lords and Commons then aſsembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it.</hi> And from a ſtrict Obligation to the performance of it in their ſenſe, we ſee nothing can diſcharge the ſoul, unleſs ſome <hi>publick Declaration</hi> at the taking of it; we ſay <hi>publick,</hi> for otherwiſe there was a deliberate, voluntary deceiving the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that impoſed it: and we think <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh a great deal of reaſon, when he tels us that—<hi>Whoſoever deceiveth the expectation of him to whom he ſwears, can be no leſs then a perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> (Which paſſage Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> quoteth out of him.)</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Nor (that <hi>Parliament</hi> being now extinct) can we imagine how we ſhould better conclude their ſenſe, then by conſidering the words themſelves, in which they expreſſed this obligation, and taking a view (ſo far as we can) of their precedent and ſubſequent Acts or Ordinances. The words of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo far as concerns our purpoſe, are found in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Article thus,</p>

                     <hi>That we ſhall in like manner, without reſpect of perſons, endeavour the extirpation of Popery and Prelacy,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>Church-Government by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops,</hi> their <hi>Chancellours, and Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other Eccleſiaſtical Officers, depending upon that Hierarchy; Superſtition, Haereſie, Schiſm, Prophaneſs, and whatſoever ſhall be found to be contrary to ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the power of Godlineſs, leſt we partake in other mens ſins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues: and that the Lord may be one, and his Name one in theſe three Kingdoms.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The thing here Covenanted for, is an <hi>Indeavour</hi> to extirpate <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy:</hi> That we might the better underſtand what they meant by <hi>Prelacy,</hi> they tell us, <hi>It is the Government of the Church by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops,</hi> their <hi>Chancellours, Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other Eccleſiaſtical Officers depending upon that Hierarchy.</hi> Certainly he that runs may read, and here is no great need of an <hi>Interpreter.</hi> We have not Covenanted againſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> (every Miniſter is a Biſhop) but againſt the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of Biſhops; but in regard that the Prelacy <hi>of Biſhops</hi> is of ſeveral kinds, there poſſibly may remain a queſtion, What <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> intended in the Covenant?</p>

               <p n="9">§. 9. We call that a Paternal <hi>Prelacy,</hi> where the Colledge of Presbyters hath a <hi>Prelate</hi> who muſt concur with them (ordinarily) in Ordinations, and acts of Juriſdiction. This (ſay the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men was all the <hi>Prelacy</hi> which ever was allowed in the <hi>Church of England;</hi> we are ſure this is all for which there can be the leaſt pretence of any <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical authority.</hi>

There being no queſtion but that the Covenant is to be interpreted againſt the firſt; the queſtion only remains concerning the two latter, Whether, together with the <hi>Popiſh Prelacy of ſole and ſingle Juriſdiction,</hi> it was not the deſign of the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> then aſſembled, to oblige the people of <hi>England</hi> to extirpate alſo that <hi>Paternal Prelacy,</hi> for which ſome plead, yea both the name and thing of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> though meerly reſpecting order in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conventions? That we may make up a juſt judgement in the caſe, let us take a view of their preceding and ſubſequent Acts.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. They had by an Act (wherein the King joyned with them) taken from the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> all powers of <hi>inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Penalties, Fines, Amercements, Impriſonments,</hi> or any <hi>corporal puniſhment upon any of the Kings ſubjects, for any matter or thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as alſo all power of adminiſtring Oaths to any perſons in any caſe belonging to Eccleſiaſtical cogniſance.</hi> In the year 1643. the <hi>Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114690:22"/> is <hi>made</hi> and <hi>impoſed,</hi> in the terms before expreſſed. In the year 1646. they firſt eſtabliſh the Presbyterian Government for three years by their Ordinance (which 1648. they renew again, and make it <hi>ſine Die.</hi>) In the year 1646. They (by their <hi>Ordinance</hi>) aboliſh, <hi>the Name, Title, Stile and Dignity—of all Biſhops within the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales.</hi> We muſt confeſs, we ſhould have been very inclinable to have judged, that the <hi>ſenſe of the Parliament</hi> impoſing the Covenant, was againſt all manner of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and that they deſigned no leſs, than the engaging of the whole Nation upon the higheſt ſecurity imaginable, to endeavour the total extirpation of all the kinds of it; had we not been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that at that time, the <hi>ſcruple</hi> was made by ſome Members in Parliament, and reſolved (with the conſent of our Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi>) that it was only intended againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as then eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> which gives us a Latitude, for a <hi>Prelacy of meer order</hi> (as a civil conſtitution)</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. In the mean time, the Covenant apertly obligeth us againſt <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Deans, Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters Arch-Deacons, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. (there is no ambiguity in thoſe terms) And 2. <hi>Against all ſuch exerciſe of Prelacy, as is by any ſingle perſon, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating to himſelf ſole and ſingle Juriſdiction, or ſole and ſingle power in Ordinations.</hi> 3. <hi>Againſt</hi> all ſuch exerciſe of <hi>Prelatical power,</hi> as is taken away by the <hi>Statute of</hi> 17 <hi>Caroli,</hi> for the taking away the <hi>High-Commiſſion-Court.</hi> As to all theſe, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſenſe is clear enough, and can admit of no diſpute. Nor is this a rigid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Covenant, but as favourable as the words of it can bear, or reaſon allow upon the view of what hath been already urged to evince the ſenſe of the Impoſers.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. We conclude then, That <hi>our ſolemn Covenant</hi> was the higheſt ſecurity wherein it was poſſible, that the Eternal God, could have us engaged to him; or which the Lords and Commons, then aſſembled in Parliament, or our Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> could then take of us, <hi>That we would in our Callings and Places endeavour to root out that Prelatical form and exerciſe of Church-Government, which was exerciſed in England, by Archbiſhops</hi> (tyrannical) <hi>Biſhops, their Chancellors, Arch-Deacons, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. From which every reaſonable Chriſtian muſt conclude, that if we fail in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, by eſtabliſhing that Government again, or deſiring the eſtabliſhment of it, by promoving, owning, or countenancing of what we have thus ſolemnly ſworn to extirpate: Not only our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114690:23"/> Brethren will have an Action in the caſe againſt us for the violation of our truth to them; But the Righteous God will alſo have a juſt action againſt us for the irreverence ſhewed to his moſt Sacred Name. And if ever any of our Brethren with whom we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who poſſibly ſhall not be able, ſo eaſily to obtain a diſcharge of their Conſciences, ſhall be brought into a ſuffering ſtate, by thoſe whom we (contrary to our ſolemn Oath) ſhall help to ſet up, they will doubtleſs have a juſt occaſion, to prefer a ſad Bill of complaint againſt us, to the juſt <hi>Judge of the whole Earth,</hi> who uſeth to hear the cry of the Afflicted. And whatſoever we may now think, or talk in the diſtempers of our mind, &amp; in the rantings of our fooliſh paſſions; whenſoever the day of Gods vengeance ſhall come upon us, according to his Word, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.3, 4. Or whenſoever we ſhall have recovered our wits again, and we can give our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences awaked out of ſleep, leave to ſpeak freely to us; it will be very hard to relieve them, unleſs we can aſſign ſuch an errour in the Covenant (and that too, as to the matter ſworn) as will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Divine Law, as a ſufficient diſcharge, as to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, and leave us nothing to do, but to humble our ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord for our taking of it. It will therefore be the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of every Soul bound in that ſacred Bond, to ſit down, and adviſedly think (before they reſolve upon the violation of ſuch an Oath) whether there were any ſuch errours: And if thoſe who think they have found them, would avoid the <hi>Infamy,</hi> which elſe will fall upon them, they will ſtand concerned, to ſet down <hi>theſe errours,</hi> and publiſh them to the world in <hi>plain</hi> words of truth and ſoberneſs, not in the inſignificant figures of wanton Rhetorick, wofully blurred too with fooliſh paſſion, which may poſſible, ſatisfie ſuch as were before reſolved to be ſatisfied, and make a Bumble ſufficient for the eyes of ſome ſilly ſouls, and give the wiſer ſort of people opportunity to make themſelves merry; but can never ſtop the mouth, or darken the light, of a waky and well-informed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

VVE ſaid before, that whoſo fancieth, an eſcape for his ſoul from the obligation of the Covenant, once taken, muſt be put to the trouble, to aſſign ſome <hi>errour</hi> ſufficient to diſcharge him, the ſufficiency of which, muſt be alſo judged by the Word of God, becauſe from that an Oath derives its Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory vertue. That there may be ſuch errours in Oaths that we have taken is granted, whether in this Oath, there be or no, is the queſtion. If there be any, we muſt find it either in the <hi>formal</hi> or <hi>material,</hi> or <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>final</hi> cauſe: For we ſhall hardly find any in any appendant circumſtance, which will be of ſuch force.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. And verily there is a variety found out (relating to the three latter Cauſes) by ſuch as have ſpent their time to ſeek them. <hi>They have ſought falſe witneſſes againſt</hi> the Covenant, to put it to death, but we hope before we have done, to prove not only <hi>that they have found none.</hi> (for their teſtimonies have neither agreed to the Propoſitions of the Covenant, nor yet to the matters of fact, relating to Divine Providence, nor yet each with other) but alſo to diſcharge them from their uſeleſs employment in <hi>ſeeking knots in ſo even a ruſh,</hi> by proving that none can be found, ſo that they muſt be forced to cut this <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, becauſe it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. As to the material cauſe. The matter of every Oath of Covenant being either <hi>neceſſary, unlawful</hi> or <hi>indifferent:</hi> And each of theſe again being <hi>poſſible</hi> or <hi>certain,</hi> or impoſſible, or uncertain. If the matter of the Oath (to which we are ſpeaking) be <hi>neceſsary,</hi> as commanded us by the Word of God; or <hi>indifferent,</hi> where Gods Word hath left us at a liberty, except it be impoſſible, we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114690:24"/> are certainly bound to the performance of it, by our Oath, in the judgment of all Divines that we ever yet met with. From whence every conſcientious Chriſtian (by the way) muſt needs conclude thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the Officers as to the external adminiſtration of the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel, be ſo determined by the Word of God, That no Church under Heaven, nor any other powers, can make any alteration in them, but only ratifie and confirm what God hath there appointed. Then, unleſs we can find that Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, are the Officers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods Word, for the Government of his Church, we are moſt certainly obliged by our Oath, to endeavour their extirpation:</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe although we had not ſworn, yet we are bound as Chriſtians, to endeavour in <hi>our place and calling,</hi> that the Church to which we belong, have in it no Plants which are not of our Heavenly Fathers planting, and according to our former rule, what we are bound to do without an Oath, we are much more (having ſworn) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the Government of the Church be not ſo determined by the Word of God, as to the external Adminiſtrators of it, but it be in the power of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> to add ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, not there mentioned, or to chuſe what Form they pleaſe; yet we having ſworn againſt this <hi>Form of Government,</hi> and againſt <hi>theſe Officers,</hi> we cannot ſet them up nor own them, but muſt, if they be impoſed upon us, ſuffer under them: The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of the Oath was indifferent <hi>&amp; libera,</hi> and <hi>Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum tollit libertatem,</hi> we having ſworn, it is to us no longer free.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. No one can challenge the Covenant as giving an uncertain ſound, at leaſt, not as to this Branch of it; What we ſware to, was not the <hi>general will</hi> of another, nor the unknown <hi>Rights, Statutes,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges of a Society</hi> (yet many Oaths of that kind are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful by <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and generally judged obligatory though not without ſome exceptions) but the thing in this Oath is expreſſed, <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the particular ſpecies of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> ſet down as plainly as can be imagined; ſo that there can be no eſcape, for any ſoul that <hi>feareth an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. It remaineth therefore, that thoſe who plead the <hi>non-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of this Oath, and have ſet up this new trade of <hi>abſolving</hi> ſouls from it, muſt aſſert the matter of it <hi>unlawful,</hi> either <hi>primarily,</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114690:24"/> 
                  <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> either in its <hi>own nature,</hi> or in reſpect of ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> tels us, that an Oath (as to the <hi>matter of it</hi>) is unlawful in its own <hi>nature, primarily, when it is contrary to the Word of God.</hi> (Secondarily) <hi>When it is contrary to the juſt Lawes of any community in which we are involved:</hi> That an <hi>Oath</hi> may as to the matter of it be unlawful <hi>(ex accidenti)</hi> when it <hi>hinders ſome good,</hi> or occaſioneth ſome evil to our ſelves, or to others, when a mans own Conſcience judgeth it unlawful. Others add, when it is <hi>contradictory</hi> to it ſelf, or to ſome <hi>former Oaths,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. But the Caſuiſts generally agree, that every <hi>unlawful Oath</hi> is not preſently void (if once taken) it will be neceſſary therefore not only to examine, whether the Covenant (as to the matter of it). were unlawful, but whether it were ſo <hi>unlawful,</hi> that it doth not (now being taken) oblige, which unqueſtionably it was, if (as ſome pretend) it were contrary to the Word of God, in this particular; for no ſoul can be by an Oath bound to ſin againſt God, according to that known Rule, <hi>Juramentum non potest eſſe vinculum iniquitatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. But thoſe who plead the <hi>Obligation of the Covenant</hi> (upon this account) null, will eaſily underſtand, that they will ſtand concerned to prove from the Word of God, That God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where determined, that either his <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> or his <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church in England,</hi> ſhould inalterably be governed by <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Arch-Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. Which when they have done, we will freely grant them that the Covenant in that Point doth not oblige: But this is ſuch a task, as none we have met with durſt undertake.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. That therefore which they chiefly inſiſt upon, is, that the matter of the Covenant was ſecondarily unlawful, as contrary to the Lawes of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi>-communities in which we are involved, where we have two things to do, 1. To examine, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they ſay be truth.</hi> And 2. To examine whether it be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. The Church is either <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Univerſal,</hi> or <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi> Either <hi>Entitive, Miniſterial</hi> or <hi>Organical.</hi> When we ſpeak of a Church ſuppoſed to be in a capacity to make Lawes, obliging others, we muſt underſtand an <hi>organnical, repreſentative Church,</hi> either <hi>Catholick,</hi> or <hi>National,</hi> or <hi>Provincial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114690:25"/>§. 11. The Catholick Church in this ſenſe, muſt conſiſt, <hi>of a due proportion of Members ſent from all particular Churches in the world, who meeting in a Synod, ſhall determine, or have determined ſuch and ſuch things;</hi> and we do confeſs (though we dare not aſſert ſuch Lawes univerſally obliging to all Chriſtian People to the worlds end) that we have and ſhould have a great reverence, for ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. But we do not believe that ever any ſuch an Aſſembly met upon the earth, nor do we believe the world in a capacity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene ſuch an one, we have indeed read of ſome Councils called Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, but beſides that, we find no ſuch Law made by them, neither do we believe them to have been ſuch Aſſemblies, ſtrictly conſidered.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. They muſt therefore underſtand the <hi>National Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Which may be taken (as we ſaid before) <hi>entitively,</hi> or <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganically.</hi> In the firſt ſence, <hi>The Church of England is the whole number of Chriſtian people in England, profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith:</hi> But when we ſpeak of a Church making Lawes, we muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Church in this Notion; but muſt underſtand it conſidered as <hi>organical;</hi> and then their power of making <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> obligatory to others, muſt be derived either from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or from the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> What power can be pretended from the Word of God, muſt be bottomed upon <hi>Acts</hi> 15. From whence all that is poſſible to be concluded, is this, <hi>That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches of Chriſtians have a power given them by the Word of God, to chuſe fitting Meſſengers, which being ſo choſen,</hi> and <hi>met together, may conſult and determine, in ſome Eccleſiaſtical caſes.</hi> But certain it is, there was never ſuch a National Convention in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that we need not enquire the matter of Fact, nor the force and power of ſuch decrees, how far, and in what caſes, they do oblige either preſent or future Generations.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. The power which any <hi>Synod, Convocation,</hi> or <hi>Convention</hi> met at any time in <hi>England,</hi> can pretend to have had, muſt be either from the Pope before the Reformation in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8th. or by vertue of ſome Act of Parliament ſince that time.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Our <hi>Abſolvers</hi> talk ſo much of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> and the Lawes of the <hi>Church</hi> and Sons of the <hi>Church,</hi> by which they mean the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> (though it will be hard for them interpreting the <hi>Church,</hi> in that notion to anſwer the Papiſts, asking them where our Church was before <hi>Luther;</hi> for I am ſure we had no Proteſtant Prelacy before that time) that it will not be amiſs for us to take a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114690:25"/> view of the Church of <hi>England</hi> under this Notion, and conſider what power ſhe had (and from whom derived) to make any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Lawes, that ſhould be this day ſo obligatory, that an Oath taken againſt them muſt be forthwith void.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. We are indeed told by ſome Eccleſiaſtical Writers of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> who about the year 170. was an Inſtrument of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> and that he in ſtead of the Paganiſh <hi>Arch-Flamins</hi> and <hi>Flamins,</hi> eſtabliſhed 28 <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but the evidence of it is ſo feeble, that we find few giving any credit to it, much leſs was the Nation ſo early chriſtianized ſo far, as to have any Synod ſo full, as to make Lawes obliging the whole Nation: Nor indeed is there any Authentick Records of any conſiderable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Synod till near the year 600; then Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent over <hi>Auguſtine the Monk,</hi> to convert the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and he made haſt in his work, baptizing 10000 in a day. This doubtleſs was the man who firſt founded <hi>Prelacy in England</hi> (himſelf being the firſt Arch-Biſhop) in conformity to the Order of the Romiſh Church, whence he came; we know that it is ſaid by ſome, that when he came, her found here one Archbiſhop and ſeven Biſhops, but no ſuch thing appears in his Letters, not are their Names, or places of reſidence expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by Authority derived from the Pope, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth Biſhops, calleth a Synod, and enacteth Lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From that time, which was the year 586. to the year 1205. we have no Record of any Eccleſiaſtical Lawes, made in <hi>England,</hi> the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here were doubtleſs governed by the Popiſh Canon Law. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that time there were 43 Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (if we may believe Chronologers) yet have we no Record of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory Canons were made by them.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. Betwixt 1205. and 1414. were 14 Archbiſhops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> beginning with <hi>Steph. Langton,</hi> and ending with <hi>H. Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> theſe all made ſome Provincial Lawes, which are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and put into ſome method by <hi>Lindwood.</hi> Within that time the Pope ſending over two Legates; <hi>Otho,</hi> in the year 1226. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Othobonus,</hi> in the year 1248. which was the 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. They alſo each of them made parcels of <hi>Canons,</hi> which were after collected by <hi>Johannes de Aton,</hi> and were all the Lawes of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (as they call it) in force. Nor do we read of any more done till the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. which was the year 1533. Till this time the <hi>Church of England</hi> was loſt in the Popiſh rubbiſh,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114690:26"/> (according to our Brethrens ſenſe of Church, for the Prelates, there was none other, no not one)</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. In that year the Reformation of the Church was begun by Parliament, who made an Act (printed in our Statute Book,) <hi>forbidding any of the Clergy from that time, to preſume to attempt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, claim, or to put in ure, any conſtitutions or Ordinances, Provincial or Synodal, or any other Canons;</hi> or <hi>to enact, promulge or execute any ſuch Canons,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>aſſemble to enact them, without the Kings Writ calling them together, and the Kings Highneſs his conſent ratifying them, &amp;c.</hi> So that, from that day, no Laws made by the Church could oblige us, unleſs K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. firſt called the Church-men together, and then ratified what they Decreed.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. As to all former Church-laws, the Parliament in that Act gave power to K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. to call together 32 perſons to review all old Canons, and to collect a body of Canons out of them, being not contrary to the Laws of God, nor the Laws of the Land, which when they had done, K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was to confirm them; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon the review of the old Canons, they were all by than Act abrogated, and nulled, and ſo all Canons alſo after to be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of the Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. Before theſe 32 perſons could be called, and meet and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their work, K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. dieth. The former Act not giving power to the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to call the 32 perſons, K. <hi>Edw.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3, 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> did not do it, till the <hi>Parliament</hi> meeting in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign, by a new Act, gave him alſo power with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Council, within three years to name the 32 perſons, which his father ſhould have named.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. by his Letters Patents, bearing date, at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 11 <hi>Nov.</hi> in the 5th. year of his Reign, authorizeth the 32 Perſons (whoſe Names and Powers may be ſeen by the Copy of thoſe Letters Patents, prefixed to a Book called, <hi>Reformatio Legum Eccleſiaſticarum.</hi>) They met, and within the three years time, reviewed all, and compiled that Book called as aforeſaid, (upon which according to the Statute 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. The old Canon Lawes were utterly abrogated; but before King <hi>Edward</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this new Book, he died: So that there was no Lawes of the Church of <hi>England</hi> left in any force.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. Q. <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeds, ſhe revives the old Popiſh <hi>Canon Law.</hi> Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> after her reviveth the Reformation: In her time, ſeveral Injunctions and Canons were made. After her time, K. <hi>James</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114690:26"/> a Synod, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. which made 141 <hi>Canons,</hi> but as Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> (to our knowledge) were never confirmed ſo much as by the <hi>Royal aſſent,</hi> ſo the latter were never yet confirmed by Act of Parliament, by which alone (we are told) that our Conſciences can be obliged, is perfect Lawes.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. It is obſerveable, That in the Statute 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing ſuch <hi>Canons,</hi> as ſhould hereafter be made in Convocations aſſembled by the <hi>Kings</hi> Writ, being firſt confirmed by the <hi>King;</hi> It is not ſaid, <hi>by the Kings Majeſty,</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> or <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> though in other parts of the ſame <hi>Act,</hi> thoſe words are added. It is very probable, that the want of thoſe words in the following part of the Act, concerning his <hi>Majeſties</hi> chuſing the 32 perſons to view the old <hi>Canons,</hi> was the reaſon why <hi>King Edward</hi> did not do it (King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. being dead) till a new <hi>Act</hi> was made to the ſame purpoſe, to which latter Act, K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. in his <hi>Letters Patents</hi> refers, not to that of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Nor is it yet determined whether a <hi>Kings confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> makes them <hi>Law</hi> (according to that Statute of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ſuppoſing that K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. his <hi>Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi> as well as himſelf were intended in the Statute) any longer than his Majeſties Perſon lives, who ſo <hi>ratifies</hi> and <hi>confirms</hi> them. So that it is far from being ſo clear, that we may adventure the violation of an Oath upon it, that we have this day any <hi>Canons, or conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> of force, either by the Lawes of God or of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. But admit this, where ſhall we find any ſuch Canon as this? <hi>That the Government of the Church of God in England, is, and ſhall be by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Arch-Deacons; ſo that it ſhall be unlawful, either for the People of England, in their callings and places, to endeavour the extirpation of that Form of Government, or for the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the Parliament of England, to move for, or to Vote the alteration of it, and to engage People against it by an Oath:</hi> Somthing of this nature muſt be proved, before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will be proved contrary to the Lawes of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if ſuch a <hi>Canon</hi> could be ſhewed, it is no Law; for it is contrary to the <hi>Fundamental Laws of the Nation,</hi> giving power to the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to repeal or alter any <hi>Lawes, Statutes,</hi> &amp;c. And all Canons, contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Nation, are aforehand declared void and null by the Statute, 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114690:27"/>§. 25. By what hath been ſaid, appears the vanity of their Plea, who plead that the Covenant is <hi>null</hi> and void, becauſe againſt the Lawe; of the Church: Let us come now to conſider whether they ſpeak more ſenſe or truth, who pretend it is void, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the juſt Lawes of the Nation.</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. It being apparent from the former diſcourſe, that there was no <hi>Canon-Law of England</hi> in any force at the time of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, impoſing</hi> and <hi>taking of the Covenant,</hi> the queſtion only lies concerning the civil Lawes of the Nation; which according to the Statute, 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. muſt give all the obligatory vertue, which any Eccleſiaſtical deliberations can have amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The Lawes of our Nation are uſually diſtinguiſhed into, The <hi>Common Law</hi> and the <hi>Statute Law.</hi> The firſt is not written, and <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="27">§. 27. If thoſe who plead the <hi>Covenant</hi> contrary to the <hi>Lawes of the Nation,</hi> mean, <hi>The Common Law of England,</hi> their ſenſe is no more than this, <hi>That by the conſtant uſage of the Nation of England, the Government of the Church in that Nation, hath been by Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, Chancellours, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and an Oath</hi> (impoſed by the Lords and Commons legally aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament) <hi>taken by the People, tending to the deſtruction of that ancient uſage,</hi> is <hi>void and null,</hi> yea though the <hi>King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (diſliking the firſt impoſing of it) <hi>yet afterwards, approveth his Subjects taking of it, and himſelf joynes with them, and alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it.</hi>

               <p>Yet neither will this evidence <hi>the matter of the Covenant contrary to Law.</hi> For in the <hi>Covenant</hi> we have ſworn, <hi>to endeavour the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="29">§. 29. For the <hi>Statute-Law of England,</hi> we ſhall only ſay this; That the Statute-Law which muſt be contrary to the Covenant, muſt ſpeak to this effect; <hi>The Lords and Commons aſsembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon a Legal Summons, ſhall not ſwear themſelves, nor make others ſwear, to endeavour the extirpation of Popery and Prelacy, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Church-Government,</hi> by <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. Where to find ſuch a Law we cannot tell: No, nor yet ſuch a Statute, as poſitively determines, <hi>That the Government of the Church in England is,</hi> and ſhall be <hi>by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. It is true we often in the Statutes meet <hi>with theſe Names,</hi> and we find the Statutes ſuppoſing them, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Officers,</hi> and telling us, <hi>That the Kings of England for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly founded this Church in Prelacy</hi> (what kind of Prelacy, and with what circumſtances they ſay not) but we are at a loſs for any other (ſave this implicit) eſtabliſhment by any Statute Law.</p>
               <p>And we further believe, that the <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> before the time of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8, would have taken it in foule ſcorn, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114690:28"/> any <hi>ſecular powers</hi> ſhould have gone about by <hi>a civil Law</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them: We have read of the heavy ſtir in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, when the King of <hi>England</hi> did but pretend to the Nomination of the <hi>Archbiſhop of Canterbury,</hi> and to what a baſe degree of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>children</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> humbled their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> for that offer.</p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. The truth is no more than this: The <hi>Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the beginning of our Reformation, being engaged in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to drive no further nor faſter in Reformation, than <hi>(the Lambs could go)</hi> the preſent ſtate of the Nation could bear, which at that time was but very little, the Popiſh party being then the greateſt by far, the Reformed Party ſuch as did but ſee <hi>(men like trees)</hi> imperfectly diſcerning the things that differ in Religion, were pleaſed to proportion the Reformation, accordingly, ſo as neither, the newly <hi>Reformed Party</hi> might be loſt by too much ſeeming innovation, nor the remaining <hi>Popiſh party</hi> exaſperated too far. Hence in matter of Doctrine, nothing was agreed till the year 1562. which was the 4 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> not ratified by Parliament till 1571. <hi>viz.</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> (near thirt years after the firſt beginning of Reformation) Hence in the matter of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> the ſame <hi>Lyturgy</hi> was continued, which was uſed in the <hi>Popiſh Maſs,</hi> only leaving out the Prayers to <hi>Saints,</hi> and for the <hi>Pope;</hi> and the ſecond Edition of the <hi>Common-Prayer, Anno</hi> 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. was much amended in many things, from that 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> only in the buſineſs of <hi>Kneeling</hi> at <hi>the Sacrament, Didoclavius</hi> obſerveth, it was left at liberty by the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> but commanded in the <hi>Edition</hi> of it 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. yet not without an excellent <hi>Rubrick,</hi> to expound the uſage of it (ſtill to be ſeen in the Common-Prayer-Book, Edit. 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>viz.

               <p n="31">§. 31. But ſuppoſe they were ſo eſtabliſhed, do our Brethren take it for ſuch an undoubted Goſpel-Maxim, that an <hi>Oath taken againſt the Lawes of a Nation, of what kind ſoever, written, or not written, conſonant to, or diſſonant from the Law of God,</hi> is <hi>forthwith null, and void, and no waies obliging?</hi> Do they believe this ſuch a truth, that men may venture the damnation of their ſoules upon it? and venture, <hi>the curſe of God cleaving to their houſe, till it hath conſumed the timber thereof and the ſtones thereof,</hi> Zech. 5.3. upon the truth of it? They may talk thus in drollery to their friends, or credulous Proſelytes, they may (to ſhew their grandiloquence, and liberty of phraſe) in laxe diſcourſes thus ſpeak in Pamphlets; but we are ſo well perſwaded of ſome of their skill in divinity, and of their other Learning too, that we believe they know, that <hi>no Scripture, no reaſon, no creditable authority,</hi> will juſtifie any ſuch thing, and they would be loath, that their crime, in theſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity (by which the ſoules of people are enſnared) ſhould be expiated, by that ſlight penance, of any of their ſtanding two or three daies in any of our ſchooles, to defend ſuch an atheolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical maxim, againſt what Arguments would be brought againſt it, nor would we deſire fairer play in our caſe.</p>
               <p n="32">§. 32. 1.

In the ſecond place, Our Brethren will certainly grant, <hi>that in caſe the King had immediatly conſented with his Parliament,</hi> and <hi>impoſed the Covenant, though it had been, expreſly, apertly, poſitively, against any Law or Lawes of the Nation, yet the Oath had obliged,</hi> becauſe they altogether had a power to <hi>ſuſpend annul, and abrogate any Law.</hi> It is true, this Oath was only impoſed by <hi>Lords and Commons,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:114690:29"/> the King at preſent not conſenting: We are no <hi>Lawyers,</hi> nor can we tell how far the power of <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> extends, as to the ſuſpending of the <hi>exerciſe of Lawes,</hi> or giving of <hi>Oaths.</hi> But we have heard, that 2 parts of the <hi>legiſlative power of England</hi> lies in the <hi>Lords and Commons,</hi> and that they have of themſelves given Oaths in many caſes, in what caſes, we know not: After this, his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> declares, That <hi>thoſe who had taken the Oath, ſhould leaſt offend God and him in keeping of it.</hi> His Majeſty that <hi>now is, takes the ſame Oath,</hi> declares <hi>his approbation,</hi> &amp;c.

Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> will tell them, that if the Law be <hi>poenal,</hi> and hath in it an <hi>election,</hi> either of doing the thing, or ſuffering the penalty, an Oath will bind againſt the active part. <hi>Fortaſſis poſſunt dari caſus in quibus juramentum, quod videtur alicui legi communitatis aut vocationis adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari et ſi non debuerit ſuſcipi,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe ſuch a Law, and this Law reſpecting this City eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Act of Parliament; A particular Citizen hath taken a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Oath, <hi>that he will never bear the Office of Mayoralty</hi> in that City, this man is choſen by the Freemen; What ſhall he do? Not hold (ſaith Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) but pay his money; his Oath will bind here againſt the active part of the Law: So that if there were 40. penal Lawes, which might ſeem to eſtabliſh the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> againſt which the <hi>Covenant</hi> is directed; the <hi>Covenant</hi> will bind us againſt them all, thus far, <hi>viz, to ſuffer the penalty annexed for not owning them,</hi> rather than to own and acknowledge them. But yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</p>
               <p n="35">§. 35. 4. Let us examine the reaſon, why an Oath ſhould not bind againſt Law: There can be no other pretended, but <hi>the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which God hath reſerved to Superiors over their Inferiors.</hi> So that if this which we call Law, be not clearly an eſtabliſhment of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, to whom <hi>legiſtative power</hi> belongs (which meer uſage and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114690:29"/> cuſtom is not arguing no more than <hi>permiſſion of Superiors</hi>) or if the Law be an exerciſe of dominion in things <hi>ubi non habent dominium;</hi> where Gods Word allows them no ſuch dominion, an Oath will certainly bind againſt ſuch pretended Lawes.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>An Oath taken to confirm a Bargain. which Bargain is contrary to the Law,</hi> will (ſaith he) <hi>bind, till the Church abſolves.</hi> As if one ſwears to pay an Uſurer more than the Law alloweth the Uſurer to take; or to pay a Thief a Summe of Money, to redeem his life, (ſuppoſing a Law to make ſuch a Contract void) yet the Oath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114690:30"/> would bind.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sayri</hi> claevis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, l. <hi>11.</hi> ca. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> Upon this caſe <hi>Gregor.

               <p>A third Rule he gives is this; 3. <hi>If the Oath be only contrariant to a civil Law, made only for the advantage of him that ſweareth, the Oath will bind againſt the Law.</hi> We dare not juſtifie all theſe Rules: But we will put a caſe or two to our Brethren, who are ſo free of their pardons and abſolutions in this caſe. All know that it is againſt the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that a woman (under <hi>Covert Baron</hi>) ſhould diſpoſe of her eſtate which ſhe hath in <hi>Joynture.</hi> Suppoſe now her husband proves a <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> or be <hi>impriſoned for debt,</hi> or ſuppoſe the woman, her ſelf wants money, and ſhe to furniſh her ſelf, or deliver her husband, borrowes a ſum of money, ſwearing to him of whom ſhe borrows it, that if God lets her live to enjoy her Joynture, ſome Deed which ſhe makes (againſt Law) for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Creditor, ſhall be made good (though againſt Law) Shall not her Oath bind her? The Law of <hi>England</hi> expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids giving above 6<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
                  <hi>per cent.</hi> for Intereſt: Suppoſe one ſwears, (in his neceſſity to give 8<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
                  <hi>per cent.</hi>) Will not this Oath bind, think we? in ſhort, <hi>Azorius</hi> determines bluntly; <hi>Quando contractus eſt ſolum jure civili interdictus, jurejurando confirmatur:</hi> That an Oath will bind to fulfil a contract only forbidden by a civil Law.</p>
               <p n="37">§. 37. We are not altogether ſatisfied in the Popiſh Caſuiſts reaſons, for this determination, we judge this queſtion cannot be well reſolved, without the reſolution of another very weighty que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>viz. How far humane Lawes bind the Conſcience;</hi> We do believe, that <hi>all ſuch humane Lawes as do neceſſarily tend to preſerve the Government, and tranquility of a civil ſtate, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Law of nature, and the divine Law revealed, do apertly bind the Conſcience,</hi> ſo that an Oath taken againſt them, is forthwith void. But for Lawes, <hi>not plain and certain and expreſs,</hi> nor <hi>having ſuch neceſſary tendency, to the being of a civil ſtate,</hi> nor being ſo <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Law of Nature,</hi> or <hi>written Law of God,</hi> whether they lay ſuch an hold on the Conſcience as to make void an Oath, we think deſerves our <hi>Abſolvers</hi> ſecond thoughts, poſſibly the <hi>taking of ſuch Oaths,</hi> might be at firſt inadviſed and unlawful, but being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they are voided by ſecond thoughts, that the matter of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114690:30"/> them was againſt Law, we cannot but a little doubt and believe our Brethren have few <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> or other <hi>Divines</hi> of their minds in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="38">§. 38. Nor yet is this our caſe, where the <hi>Lords and Commons legally aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> to whom (though not ſolely) the legiſlative power belongs, do themſelves take, and require others to take an Oath, to endeavour the extirpation of a Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they apprehended inconvenient; which it is true was eſtabliſhed by the uſage of a long tract of time, but no poſitive Law was exiſtent, directing it as the Government of the Church in <hi>England</hi> (though ſeveral indeed ſuppoſed it) that an Oath ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and impoſed, doth not oblige againſt ſuch a pretended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect legal eſtabliſhment, is we confeſs, a piece of divinity, the depth of which we cannot fathom, nor yet believe that there is any truth in it. If any of our Brethren in earneſt think otherwiſe, they ſhould do well to bring forth their <hi>ſtrong Reaſons,</hi> or to tell us what one Divine, Ancient, or Modern is of their minds: till that time, it is ſufficient for us out of a reverence to the ſacred Name of God, to diſſent from them in this notion, proved as yet, by no <hi>Scripture,</hi> no <hi>reaſon,</hi> nor any <hi>creditable authority.</hi>

England,</hi> moſt parts of <hi>Germany, Schiſmaticks:</hi> (For that is nothing with thoſe with whom we have to do) but it would alſo ſuperſede all <hi>civil power</hi>'s thoughts for ever medling with the Government of the Church, for fear of <hi>violating</hi> an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the order of the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and being poſted up for Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. But is it ſo indeed? Or is this the noiſe of thoſe who thunder thus, becauſe they cannot hope with any ſolid Arguments to do much; let us a little conſider theſe <hi>big phraſes,</hi> and ſee what they ſignifie.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:114690:31"/>
               <p>The Papiſts have ſo enured us to this ſuffering under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Schiſmaticks, for breaking off from the order of their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> that we begin not ſo much to regard the Charge, or at leaſt, not to believe every one who calls out <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> when they have nothing elſe to ſay.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Schiſm</hi> properly ſignifies, a <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Breach,</hi> which when it is from or in the community of a Church, is very ſinful, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt the Command of God directly, and interpretatively; but it muſt be from the Communion of a Church walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Divine Rule, otherwiſe (if the Churches deviation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially be great) there's no great fear of any guilt by Schiſm, in departing from it.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. If indeed God by his Word, hath any where appointed, that the Government of his Univerſal Church, ſhall be by <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, Archdeacons, Chancellours, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c. and the Church hath alwaies walked in that order, we confeſs then that out Oath againſt it, is <hi>Schiſmatical:</hi> But we deſire our Brethren to prove this.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Nay if God hath left the Church to its liberty, to ſet up what Form of <hi>Government</hi> ſhe pleaſes, and the Univerſal Church hath at any time met in a perfect General Council, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this inalterable Form, or by an univerſal practiſe hath kept to ſuch a Form, there may be ſome colour to charge us, but neither ſhall our Brethren prove this to us.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. We challenge all the friends of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> to make it good from any authentick Record, that for three hundred years after Chriſt, there were any ſuch Creatures known in the Church of God, as <hi>Archbiſhops, Archdeacons, Prebends, Commiſsaries, Chancellors.</hi> Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> indeed in the 3 Century, is called the <hi>chief Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (in the fabulous decretal Epiſtles) but <hi>Cyprian</hi> writing to him, cals him no more than his Colleague. In the 4 Century, we read of <hi>Biſhops, Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons, Ambroſe</hi> mentions them. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> mention no more in this age. <hi>Hierom</hi> (in his Epiſtle to <hi>Nepotianus,</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">l. de Dign. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdot.</note> that <hi>Biſhops and Preſbyters were the ſame,</hi> only the latter were the younger men. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tels us they had one and the ſame <hi>Ordination.</hi> Indeed towards the end of the 4 <hi>Century</hi> (which was 400 years after Chriſt) they began to multiply Eccleſiaſtical Officers, then came in <hi>Readers</hi> and <hi>Exorciſts, Subdeacons, Archdeacons,</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> &amp;c. But we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forſook the Order of the Church at that time, when it was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114690:32"/> wofully declined from its Primitive Purity, and ſhall be no more guilty of Schiſm in going a little further.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. We ſaid before, that we find in Eccleſiaſtical ſtory early men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but not of ſuch as ours were in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Biſhops, 1. <hi>Lay claim to a ſole and ſingle power in Ordination and Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are not choſen by the People nor Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They are attended with Deans and Prebends, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They execute their power by Lay Chancellours, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They have uſed to exerciſe a power in depriving Miniſters, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſilencing, excommunicating,</hi> for trivial caſes, not paying a Tythe <hi>Gooſe</hi> or <hi>Pig,</hi> &amp;c. Let our Brethren ſhew us ſuch an Epiſcopacy, (before Antichriſt was up in his Throne) if they can; if not, they vainly charge us with <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in ſwearing to endeavour the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a <hi>Prelacy,</hi> for which is no foundation, in the practiſe, either of the Primitive or any Reformed Church.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. We are further told (how truly comes next to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that the Covenant was void, becauſe the matter of it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted former <hi>Oaths.</hi> They mention four: of <hi>Allegiance, Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> of <hi>Canonical obedience,</hi> and that taken by the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> at their Coronation. If this be true, it is unqueſtionably void, for <hi>Juramentum prius prejudicat poſteriori:</hi> But conſidering, that the Covenant was agreed and taken, by the Members of the graveſt Convention of the Nation, and by ſo many Reverend Divines, it will not be amiſs to enquire whether of a truth it be ſo or no, that if we find it true, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> and People, may all do obeiſance to <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as having unwarily ſuffered their grave and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ears to be nailed to the doors of its houſe, and obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be its Servants for ever.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. As to the Oath of Allegiance, there is no mention of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops</hi> nor <hi>Biſhops</hi> in it, we have only ſware <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to his Majeſty; which we hope we may give, and yet endeavour in our callings to extirpate <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> &amp;c. If any one ſay, What if he ſhall command the ſetting of it up? We would fain know of our Brethren, what we ſhould do, if Popery ſhould be hereafter by any Prince commanded? But to ſpeak directly. 1. <hi>We believe that Prelacy had no juſt footing in England, but what it had by Authority of Parliament.</hi> 2. <hi>We believe it in the power of King and Parliament, to ſuspend or abrogate any Lawes, and to engage people by Oaths for ever obliging, againſt the matter of them.</hi> 3. <hi>We know
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114690:32"/> both King and Parliament by their Act</hi> 17 Car. <hi>did take away much of the Prelates juriſdiction.</hi> 4. <hi>We know that the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did ſuſpend all other power of Arch-Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and engage the people of England by Oath againſt the reſtoring of it.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">We aſſert the truth of this no further then as we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Narrations.</note> VVhich <hi>Oath</hi> his ſacred Majeſty afterwards <hi>ratified and confirmed for ever. We beleeve none can abſolve us from an Oath but God onely.</hi> Our Allegiance therefore can onely (in caſe of ſuch commands) be ſhewed, in our patient, humble ſubmiſſion to ſuch penalties, as ſhall be inflicted upon us, for not yielding active Obedience, contrary to our Oaths.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. So that a man might, and may bear <hi>Faith,</hi> and true <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> to his Majeſty, and yet take an Oath to endeavour in our callings, the Extirpation of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> or <hi>Prelacy,</hi> in two caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In caſe our Allegiance to God, required ſuch an endeavour of us in our places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe <hi>his Majeſties command of ſubmiſſion to that Prelacy, comes after my Oath to the contrary (ratified by himſelf.)</hi> And I can find no more in that Oath which can be pretended as contradictory to the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. The next <hi>Oath</hi> which they mention, is that of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> This Oath was eſtabliſhed by the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. being deviſed to ſecure the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to the Supreme Civil Magiſtrate of <hi>England,</hi> from acknowledging the forreign juriſdiction of the Pope. VVhat can be fetched from this Oath muſt be either from the firſt part; where having declared, that <hi>we do in conſcience beleeve the King is the onely Supreme Governour in England, as well in things Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical as Civil,</hi> in oppoſition to any forreign <hi>Prince, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Prelate, State,</hi> or <hi>Potentate;</hi> and thereupon we renounce ſuch pretended <hi>forreign Juriſdiction,</hi> and <hi>promiſe Faith and Allegiance.</hi> Or elſe it muſt be in the latter clauſe, where we promiſe <hi>to aſsist and defend all juriſdictions, priviledges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>annexed to the Imperial Crown of England.</hi> For the former part we are not able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what in the Covenant is contrary to it? The Covenant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the King the ſupreme moderation of all Eccleſiaſtical and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual cauſes (if Gods word will allow it) for there's nothing any can pretend againſt it, except they plead that then our <hi>Reformation</hi> cannot be <hi>according to the word of God</hi> (which for our parts we think very falſe.) The Covenant doth not in the leaſt acknowledge the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114690:33"/> of any forreign Princes, Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the latter part, where we promiſe to <hi>aſsiſt</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>Juriſdictions and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges annexed to the Imperial Crown.</hi> So ſaith the Covenant;—<hi>his Majeſties Perſon, Honour, and Authority</hi>—. Ah! but the <hi>ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> muſt be contrary to this Oath, becauſe it is the <hi>Right of the Crown</hi> to chuſe <hi>Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. (How this Plea will ſtand with their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy of <hi>Apoſtolical right</hi> let them conſider.) I would fain (to make the buſineſs ſhort) know, <hi>whether ſome of theſe Rights of the Crown may not by conſent of the King be parted with? and whether his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty when he took the Covenant did not part with them?</hi> We had before only ſworn to endeavour the extirpation of theſe Officers, in all our callings by lawfull means and wayes: (Such now as <hi>Petitioning the King,</hi> &amp;c.) His Majeſty that now is, at the entreaty of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> parts with this <hi>Right,</hi> by ſwearing to extirpate thoſe Officers, to the nomination of which he before had a right. May not we now keep the <hi>Oath of Supremacie,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> too?</p>
               <p>Nor can that general terme oblige us any further, than to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and maintaining all ſuch Juriſdictions, Priviledges, and Rights, <hi>annexed to the Imperial Crown,</hi> which are not contrary to the Word of God.— But there needs no more be urged againſt this vain plea; eſpecially conſidering that very few men in <hi>England</hi> of thoſe that took the Covenant had ever taken the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> which onely belonged to <hi>Eccleſiastical perſons, Graduates in Univerſities,</hi> and <hi>publique Officers.</hi> Which did not make the hundredth part of thoſe who took the Covenant in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. The third Oath, to which (it is pretended) the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is contrary, is the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> which concerns no more than ſuch as were made Miniſters before 1641. or at leaſt very few, ſo that much need not be ſaid to it now. Indeed all thoſe, or at the leaſt moſt of thoſe that have been in the Miniſtry twenty yeares, when they were Ordained, did promiſe, Reverently to <hi>Obey their Ordinary:</hi> And after this (by what Law I cannot tell) did ſwear (at leaſt when they had Inſtitution granted them by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to any living) that <hi>they would obey him in things lawfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</hi> And alſo did ſubſcribe the 39 Articles, where the 36. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle doth approve of the <hi>form of Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here now is 1. a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Obedience to the Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Oath</hi> to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:114690:33"/>3. A <hi>Subſcription,</hi> that the form of the Conſecration of <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> &amp;c. contains in it nothing <hi>contrary to the Word of God.</hi> Now it is ſaid, that he who took the Covenant, bound himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary bond, which latter bond by that reaſon is voyd <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. But (beſides that, this Plea will abſolve very few, as we ſaid before) we are not able to fathom the depth of this Argument, for the Abſolution of any. The Queſtion is here, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether he that hath ſubſcribed, that the form of Conſecration of Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expreſſed in the Common-Prayer book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing in it contrary to the Word of God; and who hath promiſed Obedience to his Ordinary, and ſworn to it, may not (after this) take an oath in his calling to endeavour the extirpation of the Government by <hi>Arch-Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Firſt, ſuppoſe that upon mature deliberation, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ſubſcribed, and took that Oath of Canonical Obedience, find that it was an unlawfull Oath or Subſcription, as obliging them to the acknowledgement of ſuch a power in the Church, as is by no means allowed in the Word of God, they are in ſuch a caſe onely obliged to be humbled for their raſh ſubſcription and taking of that Oath, and their Second Oath againſt them will hold valid.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſecondly; ſuppoſe that that Oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> was impoſed <hi>without authority of Parliament:</hi> And the <hi>Parliament</hi> as ſoon as they took notice of it, declared their diſſent to it, and to all <hi>Oathes</hi> impoſed without their <hi>authority:</hi> Certainly this ſhould go far with them, who make the like plea againſt us, as to the Obligation of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. But, thirdly; we will for once ſuppoſe the Oath mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially good and lawfull as to the efficient cauſe; yet certainly the Oath is irritated and made voyd by the Parliaments taking away of the matter of it. Nor do we underſtand how any perſon by a <hi>promiſe or an oath to be obedient in things lawfull and honeſt, to this or that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> doth oblige himſelf whatever evil he ſeeth in ſuch a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, either through want of juſt title, or male-adminiſtration of his truſt, never, to endeavour <hi>to free himſelfe from that ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> If indeed we had ſworn in the Oath of Canonical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, never to have endeavoured the <hi>Extirpation of the Government,</hi> then to have taken the Covenant, had been to have ſworn to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and the firſt Oath would have made the latter voyd, unleſs the matter of the firſt had been proved to have been unlawfull, and ſo the firſt Oath had been <hi>Vinculum iniquitatis.</hi> But we ſhall need add
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114690:34"/> no more in anſwer to this Plea, which if it were good, could abſolve very few.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. The next Oath, to which they pretend the Covenant to be contradictive, is <hi>the Oath</hi> which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> take at their <hi>Coronation:</hi> We muſt confeſs we are not ſo fit to ſpeak to this (being no Lawyers) onely thus much at firſt offers its ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his Majeſty who now is, hath not taken it as yet, but hath taken the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot find, that the King doth ſwear, to maintain and uphold the Government of the Church by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and never to conſent to an Act of Parliament for the extirpation of them, there is certainly no ſuch thing. <hi>Ah but he ſwears to defend the rights of the Church (they will ſay) and Epiſcopacy is one of the rights of the Church.</hi>—The <hi>Oxford men</hi> quote the paſſages of the <hi>Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oath,</hi> which they conceive the Covenant contradicting: Thus He ſwears,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he will keep, grant, and confirm the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes granted to the Clergy by the glorious King,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. We doubt whether both theſe clauſes be to be found in any Coronation Oath which our Princes have taken. If Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> gives us a true relation, neither of them were promiſed by <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. We find them indeed both, the firſt in the Oath which King <hi>James</hi> took at his <hi>Coronation in England:</hi> the ſecond in the Oath which K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt took in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they might (for ought I know) be put together in the Oath which K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt took in <hi>England;</hi> where there was certainly an alteration made in the forms of prayer lately uſed (ſome were added which were omitted ever ſince <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. time,<note place="margin">Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> p. 20.</note> ſaith Mr. <hi>Le-Strange</hi>) the ſame Gentleman avows there was no alteration made in the Oath. 2. It ſeems ſtrange to us that the <hi>Reverend Biſhops,</hi> ſhould put the King to ſwear the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> granted to the Church by <hi>Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> many of which were before taken away by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> as may be ſeen by comparing the Acts of Parliament ſince the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. with the Records of thoſe Grants of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Confeſſor,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114690:34"/> which the Reader may find in the cloſe of Sir <hi>H. Spilmans Concilia Pambrittanica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. However it is certaine that one thing which the King alſo ſware, was the Government of the Nation, according to the <hi>Laws of the Land made, or to be made,</hi> ſo that his Oath for confirming the Churches <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> muſt be interpreted, as to thoſe Rights which were, and ſhould continue ratified by the Laws of the Land; otherwiſe there was a manifeſt contradiction in the Oath, as to thoſe two paſſages.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. For the Kings Oath, to maintain <hi>the Biſhops and their Churches,</hi> it contradicts not the Covenant, which ſtrikes at nothing but <hi>Prelacy of Biſhops, Arch-biſhops, Chancellors, Deans, Prebends,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their Churches may be preſerved in <hi>England,</hi> though theſe be extirpated. But no more need be ſaid as to our preſent caſe; for the Oath which any former King of <hi>England</hi> took concerned onely himſelf. <hi>Obligatio juramenti est perſonalis non realis,</hi> (as I think all Caſuiſts agree.) His Majeſty that now is, is obliged by no ſuch Oath.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. For the <hi>Contradiction</hi> which Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> aſſignes in the Covenant to the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> (by which we ſware to preſerve the <hi>Liberties of Subjects</hi> (out of which number <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters</hi> are not to be excepted) it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an anſwer; for by the ſame Argument (after that Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken) the Parliament could not have queſtioned any one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, or any other perſon (at leaſt not annull their office) which certainly none will aſſert, ſince their Liberties, as Subjects, might be preſerved ſure, and yet their Liberties as Prelates, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Abſolvers Plea for the irritation of the Covenant, from the ſuppoſed Contradictions in it ſelf, Confuted: and the Covenant (notwithſtanding this ſuggeſtion) proved valid, and obligatory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. HAving reconciled the Covenant to former Oathes, it is time that we ſhould reconcile it to it ſelf: for, as through its fighting with its elders and betters, 'tis poſſible an Oath may ſo loſe its ſtrength, that it cannot hold a ſoul; ſo by hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictings within it ſelf too, 'tis poſſible it may contract that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; no man being bound to do things contradictory, which indeed were impoſſible, at leaſt in this caſe which we have before us. And this ſeems a task reaſonable for us, conſidering that the Adverſaries of the Covenant, have arraigned it of this before the world, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. I ſhall onely premiſe this, <hi>That where a man by an Oath, Vow, Covenant, obligeth himſelf unwarily to doe many things, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he finds that two of theſe things are contradictory, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of them diſchargeth his obſervance, yet he will ſtand bound to doe the other thing contained in that bond.</hi> An Oath may be unlawfull in ſome part, and yet Obligatory; unlawfull as to ſome part, and yet obligatory as to other parts.<note place="margin">Dr. Sanderſon de Jur. prom. prael. <hi>3.</hi> ſect. <hi>5.</hi> Aq. <hi>22.</hi> q. <hi>89.</hi>

                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> of old, and Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> tell us, that in caſe a man <hi>hath ſworn to things which he finds impoſſible to be performed, yet he is obliged, ad faciendum quantum poteſt,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as much of it as he can. So that thoſe who would diſcharge people from the obligation of the Covenant, as to <hi>the extirpation of Prelacy,</hi> muſt ſhew us, that there is ſomething in the Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to that particular, or elſe they ſay nothing to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. By reaſon of other allegations the firſt taking of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant might be unlawfull, but (being taken) as to this, it will be found obliging.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Both for this, and the other Branches of the Covenant, we muſt confeſs our ſelves to have ſo much reverence for the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> then aſſembled in Parliament, for the <hi>Reverend Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> for the <hi>Parliament and Church of Scotland,</hi> for all thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114690:36"/> Miniſters, and judicious Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> who ſo freely took the Covenant, that we are not eaſie to beleeve, that an Oath upon mature deliberation, could have been ſwallowed and impoſed by them, guilty of ſo palpable a fault, as contradicting it ſelf in any thing. But as to this particular (which is onely our concern to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) Thoſe that plead this, muſt produce another branch of the Covenant, obliging us to preſerve and maintain, or at leaſt not to oppoſe the Government of the Church in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Prelacy of Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends,</hi> &amp;c. which for our part we cannot find, but beleeve there is no ſuch thing (as not in the letter of it, ſo neither) by any juſt conſequence to be concluded.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Whereas Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> aſſigns this <hi>ſeeming contradiction,</hi> in that, the firſt branch bindeth us to a <hi>Reformation of the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> The ſecond branch bindeth us, to the <hi>Extirpation of Schiſm</hi> as well as <hi>Prelacy.</hi> And the third, to preſerve and defend <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon and Authority, without any diminution of his juſt Power and Greatneſs;</hi> and to preſerve the <hi>Rights and Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties of the Kingdom.</hi> And then he tels us, that <hi>Bilſon, Downham, Armagh,</hi> and others (never anſwered by any) have proved <hi>Epiſcopacy to be moſt conformable to the Word of God.</hi> 2. That <hi>Prelacy is a means, if not the only means to extirpate Schiſm:</hi> And thirdly, That the Government of <hi>Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops,</hi> are compriſed (with the Rights and Liberties of the Church) both in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and in the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> the two great Records of Engliſh Liberties.</p>
               <p>The anſwer to all this we think is very eaſie.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. To the firſt; what the Doctor meant by <hi>anſwering Bilſon,</hi> &amp;c. we cannot tell; all the world knows there have been many have called their Writings <hi>Anſwers</hi> to them. However, <hi>Bilſon's,</hi> and the others Arguments have been anſwered many times over. Beſides that, 'tis one thing to ſay <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (againſt which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not directed) is conformable to the Word of God: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to aſſert, that our Engliſh Prelacy was. If any will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove the latter, The Government of the Church moſt conformable to the Word of God, or direct us to any who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a Scriptural proof of it, we dare undertake he ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, or the <hi>Covenant</hi> (by all ſober men) confeſſed null and voyd. But this is an hard task.</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114690:37"/>§. 6. Suppoſing Prelacy were a <hi>means to extirpate Schiſm</hi> (which good effect of it we never yet ſaw) yet if it were an unlawfull, or inexpedient mean, and there were better might be uſed, and more agreeable to the Word of God, we might as well ſwear againſt that means, and for the extirpation of Schiſm, as againſt the <hi>Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> (if it were amongſt us) which yet will knock down <hi>Schiſm</hi> by as good Club-law as ever <hi>Prelacy</hi> did. As to our caſe now, the advancing of it will certainly make as great a Schiſm as ever was in any Church, and thoſe judged Schiſmaticks muſt live with it, or elſe the moſt bloody perſecution of innocent ſoules muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ever any Chriſtian Nation knew. The aſſerting of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as <hi>the onely means</hi> (by the Doctor) is not onely <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> not proved at all, but moſt falſly ſaid, witneſs the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which under Presbytery hath had fewer Schiſms than we in <hi>England</hi> under Prelacy have had, or are like to have.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. For the laſt allegation: It is true, we have ſworn to defend his <hi>Majeſties Rights, the Parliaments Priviledges,</hi> and the <hi>Subjects Liberties.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Surely they muſt be judges (we mean the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) both of their own <hi>Rights, and Priviledges,</hi> and alſo of our <hi>Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They have alſo power to diſclaim their Rights, and give away our Liberties (we being included in them.) And if they will pleaſe to give away, or part with their own <hi>Rights and Priviledges,</hi> and to diſclaim for ſome of us, ſome particular <hi>Liberties,</hi> and then impoſe an Oath upon us; for ought we know, we are bound up by ſuch Oath, nor is there any contradiction to be found here. Nor can we find the Government of the Church by <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons,</hi> either in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the <hi>Petition of Right, aſſerted as pieces of the Liberties of England:</hi> Nor were they ſuch <hi>Liberties.</hi> Certain it is, Dr. <hi>Layton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> and many others, had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to judge ſo, no more had any other perſon indeed, witneſs the proceedings in the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Starchamber,</hi> their frequent Excommunications of perſons for not paying a tythe Gooſe;<note place="margin">See the Oath prefixed to Dr. <hi>Wrens</hi> and to Dr. <hi>Montagnes</hi> Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Whether the Error of any mans Conſcience that took the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, can diſcharge him from the obſervance of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. HAving thus far cleared the Covenant (as to the matter of it) from any guilt of unlawfulneſs <hi>per ſe,</hi> either <hi>primario,</hi> or <hi>ſecundario;</hi> and ſhewed, that it is neither contrary to the holy Laws of God, nor yet to the good laws of any community wherein we are involved, that it doth not bring us under the guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> nor at all thwart any former Oaths, nor yet kill it ſelf by any private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of any member or branch of it with this, which is the matter of our debate: we muſt in the next place enquire whether it be not unlawfull, <hi>ex accedenti.</hi> Thus (ſaith our <hi>Reverend</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) an <hi>Oath</hi> may be, <hi>ex errore perſonae jurantis,</hi> or <hi>ex effectu malo rei juratae;</hi> from the error of the perſon ſwearing, or ſome ill effect of the thing ſworn: Either as it is <hi>impeditiva boni,</hi> an hindrance of ſome good, or <hi>occaſionativa mali,</hi> occaſioning ſome evil, either <hi>temporal</hi> to our ſelves, or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> to another, giving him juſt cauſe of ſtumbling and ſcandal.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Every reaſonable Chriſtian will underſtand, that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that an Oath, as to the firſt taking of it, might be <hi>unlawful,</hi> upon ſome of theſe accounts, which yet <hi>being taken, ought to be kept.</hi> Thus the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> determines concerning <hi>Oaths taken,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Jur. prom. prael. <hi>3.</hi> ſect. <hi>13, 14, 15.</hi>
                  </note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our ſelves to ſome great temporal damage (which the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> alſo determines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.) or which expoſe us to great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and concerning <hi>Oaths taken,</hi> which give <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>offence to others.</hi> It may poſſibly be that in regard of ſome ſuch things it might at firſt have been judged unlawful for ſome to have taken ſuch Oaths, but being taken (ſaith he) they are obligatory, and ought to be kept.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. There are therefore onely two queſtions can be made here: 1. VVhether an <hi>Oath obligeth</hi> where the matter is accidentally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull (at leaſt preſumed to be ſo) either from the error of the <hi>perſon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114690:38"/> ſwearing;</hi> or, 2. <hi>when it appeareth an obſtacle to ſome good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. As to the firſt; the caſe is this, Whether (ſuppoſing the matter of the Covenant lawfull) if any mans conſcience told him when he took it, that it was unlawfull; or if it now tels him ſo, he be yet obliged in conſcience to do according to his Oath.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. This caſe Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> thus determines. 1. He ſaith, <hi>That the ſoul that takes an Oath, concerning which he is, when he takes it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own conſcience that it is unlawfull</hi> (though it be an errour of his conſcience ſo to judge) <hi>ſins grievouſly.</hi> 2. He tels us, <hi>Such an Oath doth not oblige</hi> (his erroneous perſwaſion ſtill continuing.) 3. <hi>But in caſe he hath taken the Oath, and his conſcience be afterwards better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, his Oath upon his better information obligeth:</hi> Becauſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oath there is an obliging virtue, natural and inſeparable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. There is no doubt to be made of the firſt and third Branch of this determination, from whence this follows: That ſuppoſe any did take the Covenant at firſt contrary to the dictate of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet if ſince he hath ſeen his conſcience was at that time in an errour, he is by virtue of his firſt taking of it perpetually obliged to a juſt obſervance of it. The only thing in queſtion here is this; <hi>Whether ſuppoſing that any, when they firſt took the Oath, Were under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of fear or profit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſo took an Oath, which their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences told them was unlawfull, and they, bonâ ſide, think ſo ſtill. This errour of their conſcience (ſuppoſing the matter of the Covenant never ſo lawfull in it ſelf) doth not diſcharge them from any obligation to doe according to what they have ſworn to the moſt high God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaith <hi>it doth diſcharge him, and that ſuch an Oath doth not oblige him.</hi> The reaſon he gives is this: <hi>Becauſe an Oath cannot take away a former obligation, nor ſuperinduce a contrary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to any which was before upon us.</hi> But who ſo by ſwearing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the <hi>dictate of his conſcience,</hi> croſſeth <hi>that ſame dictate,</hi> which was <hi>a former obligation upon him, which this ſubſequent Oath could not remove.</hi> He therefore concludes concerning ſuch an Oath, <hi>quin ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum potius invalidum ſit, &amp; vim obligandi amittit.</hi> The term <hi>potius</hi> ſpeaks to us, that the Reverend Dr. doubted himſelf, whether indeed the error of conſcience made voyd the Oath.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. It is a very hard caſe, the hinge of the queſtion is, <hi>How far the dictate of an erroneous conſcience doth oblige.</hi> We know Divines ſay with Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that it does alwaies oblige, <hi>ad non faciendum contra,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amoſ. Caſus l. <hi>1.</hi> cap, <hi>4.11.</hi>
                  </note> to doe nothing againſt it. So alſo Dr. <hi>Amos</hi> concerning things that are but lawfull, <hi>i.e.</hi> which may be done, or not be done,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114690:38"/> he gives this reaſon for it, <hi>Becauſe a man is not bound to doe all that is lawfull.</hi> But ſuppoſe the thing to be neceſſary, <hi>i. e. ſuch as Gods Word obligeth a man to doe; and a mans erroneous conſcience tells him, that he ought not to doe it; or having done it, his conſcience tells him hee ought not to perſiſt.</hi> What ſhall he do in this caſe? <hi>We doubt whether in this caſe he be diſcharged from the obligation of his Oath, by the errour of his conſcience.</hi> And this is the caſe; For when a <hi>man hath ſworn,</hi> the <hi>fulfilling of his Oath</hi> is a thing no longer free to him, but <hi>neceſsary, in regard of the many precepts of God charging him,</hi> to take heed of <hi>ſwearing falſly,</hi> of taking Gods name in vain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that under the higheſt penalties. So that he manifeſtly ſins if he does it not. Now it ſeems to us very hard to aſſert, <hi>That a mans error of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (which is his ſin) <hi>ſhould abſolve him from ſin, and diſcharge him of the obligation of his Oath.</hi> We ſuppoſe upon ſecond thoughts, no ſober Divine will maintain it.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The truth is, The miſery of an erroneous conſcience is very great. If any man hath taken the Covenant, and his conſcience now tels him, that he took an Oath, which at that time was unlawfull for him to take, and being taken, is unlawfull to be kept. If he doth not keep it, he moſt undoubtedly ſinneth againſt God, whoſe Oath he hath violated, and whoſe precepts he hath diſobeyed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned his threatnings againſt ſuch as ſwear falſly; and yet the Oath ſeems <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to him unclean. So that if he doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, he ſinneth againſt the will of God (ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>) though not materially, and truly, yet <hi>formally,</hi> and <hi>interpretatively, becauſe what a mans conſcience dictateth to him, it dictateth under the notion of Gods will concerning him,</hi> whether it be ſo or no. So that he is under a neceſſity of ſinning contracted by his own fault, and upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>that he retains this conſcience,</hi> which he is bound to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. We preſume this is the caſe of very few in truth. If it be the caſe of any, we are afraid, that at the Great day they will find their Oath obliging, notwithſtanding the errour of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If any onely pretend ſuch a thing to get quit of their Oath, <hi>Let not our ſoul enter into their ſecrets! unto their Aſsemblies, Let not our honour be united!</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Abſolvers Plea againſt the Covenant as <hi>Impediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum boni,</hi> falſe; and if true, not concluſive, according to Caſuiſts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. VVE are now come to the laſt pretence for the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Covenant, as to the matter, from which ſome would inferre the non-obligation of it. Some late Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers, have confidently told the world, <hi>That none are bound to the Obſervance of Oaths, further, than till they ſee, that their Obſervance would hinder ſome good, which might accrue from the violation of them;</hi> which being once laid down for a Principle, it is but telling their Proſelytes, That their perſiſting in endeavours to extirpate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church by <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Prebends, Chancellours, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons,</hi> will hinder the great good, <hi>ſettlement, order, Communion with the Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. and they have preſently diſcharged all mens Soules, as they think, from the Obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. It were no dangerous matter, we think, to grant their Principle, and to challenge all of them, to inſtance in any one particular piece of good, which the reſtoring of this Government, would put us in poſſeſſion of, more than any other Government would do.</p>
               <p>Is it conformity to the Apoſtolical or Primitive Church? We challenge them all to prove any ſuch Form of Government, either in the <hi>Apoſtles times, or for ſome hundred of years after.</hi> Is it confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Reformed Churches? Are there any Biſhops in the Churches of God in <hi>Scotland, Holland, France?</hi> Are there any <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> or any ſingle Perſons challenging ſole power in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Juriſdiction in any other Reformed Church whatſoever? Are there any <hi>Deans, Prebends, Chancellours, Commiſſaries, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,</hi> &amp;c. to be found amongſt them? Indeed in the Popiſh Church there are, no where elſe, we think. Is the good they talk of, <hi>order, ſuppreſſion of Schiſm</hi> and errour? Will not Presbytery do the ſame, think we? If not, what hinders? Certainly with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114690:39"/> the help of the civil powers it will; without it, Prelacy can do nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. If we may judge by what is paſt, we have no great reaſon to promiſe our ſelves any ſuch <hi>eminent Good</hi> by <hi>Prelacy.</hi> Under that Government it was, that ſo many godly, learned and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were ſilenced, ſuſpended, impriſoned, baniſhed, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of godly people, forced to leave their Countreys, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, hunted from one place to another, they and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies undone, and all, becauſe they could not allow <hi>humane impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the worſhip of that God, who is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth,</hi> who requires to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> of them <hi>that draw nigh unto him,</hi> Lev. 10.3. and hath revealed his wrath of old againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> for doing or allowing that in his Sanctuary, which <hi>he commanded not.</hi> This is the good, <hi>England</hi> hath formerly had by them: For <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Prebends,</hi> all the good they did, was to eat up the Fruits of the Land, enjoying profits and great Revenues, for no conſiderable Service at all.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But it muſt not be granted, <hi>That our apprehending the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of an Oath, as hindring ſome good which might accrue by the violation, will diſcharge us of our Obligation to obſerve it.</hi> Indeed <hi>Gregor. Sayrus</hi> reſolves that every private perſon hath a power to commute an Oath, for ſomthing better; but <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and others,<note place="margin">Greg. Sayri <hi>clavis reg. l.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 15.</note> oppoſe him, and think the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt firſt determine the good to be better. <hi>Soto, Sanches, Cajetan, Panormitane, Arragon,</hi> and others: do allow ſome caſes, wherein they ſay, an <hi>Oath hindering ſome other good, is void.</hi> But they are all agreed in ſeveral limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt be a greater good</hi> which is hindred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This greater good muſt be no otherwiſe attaineable, than by the violation of the Oath:</hi> For if we can keep our Oath, and obtain the good too, unqueſtionably we ought to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>melius bonum,</hi> that greater good muſt be <hi>certain,</hi> not <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>disputable,</hi> and only <hi>poſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They all agree, <hi>That the Oath thus irritated and made void muſt be only made to God.</hi> For ſay they, if it be made to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, for his advantage (much more if it be a Covenant made with him upon a valuable conſideration) <hi>his conſent is neceſſary to the commutation,</hi> before the Oath can be made void. Now when our Abſolvers ſhall have ſhewed us a good certainly greater <hi>than the peace of Conſcience,</hi> which may be had from the keeping of a lawful
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114690:40"/> Oath; and make it appear to us, that this good can no other way be attained, than by breaking our Covenant, and that if we break it, we may certainly be put into poſſeſſion of it, and laſtly, that all the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> mutually engaged in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, have conſented to the violation, they ſhall have ſaid ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and till that time, this Plea conſiſts of nothing, but aëry, non-ſignificant words.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. To return to our eminent Dr. <hi>Sanderſon;</hi> He determines this caſe more like a Divine, than ſome others, Thus;—<hi>Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non eſſe illicitum aut obligandi vim amittere praecisè ob hoc quod videatur eſse impeditivum majoris boni,</hi>

He gives this reaſon, becauſe in all caſes, it is not true that every one is obliged to do what is beſt. So that our Brethren muſt deſert this Plea, and find out ſomthing elſe to prove the Oath unlawful or non-obligatory. And indeed to grant that the Proſpect of a greater Good to be obtained by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of an Oath, would diſcharge us from its obſervance, is to open ſuch a gap for all manner of perjury, as all might creep out at; and to take away all manner of ſecurity, which either God could have of his Creatures, or man of his Brother, by any verbal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1.

               <p n="2">§. 2. There are ſeveral caſes which the Dr. puts, relating to the efficient cauſe of promiſſory Oaths, under which he comprehends both the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>impulſive</hi> cauſes. As,</p>

As to the former part of the firſt caſe, whether it be <hi>unlawful to take an Oath from an uſurped power?</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it affirmatively, <hi>becauſe it becomes not a pious and couragious Chriſtian to make himſelf a ſlave;</hi> yet the ſame <hi>Dr.</hi> allowes it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if we cannot avoid it <hi>without great danger, provided that the Oath be otherwiſe lawful, and, that we do not ſhew too much forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the doing of it, but do it with ſome teſtimony of reluctancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But how fat this is applicable to the preſent caſe, we are not able to determine.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. VVE are now come to our <hi>Abſolvers</hi> ſtrong Forts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they talk, that the Covenant is <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> that it was againſt the <hi>Lawes of the Nation,</hi> they know, &amp; are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in their own Conſciences, that there is nothing in theſe Pleas, ſufficient to diſcharge any Conſcience, and therefore being purſued, hither they run, as to their ſtrong Caſtle: It was unlawful, being given and taken without the Kings conſent, and is therefore null and void. Or elſe, 2. It was a <hi>forced Oath, extorted by fear, and ſuch Oaths do not oblige;</hi> this is the Doctrine they preach to their hearers. How true it is, let us now enquire.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The foundation of any caſe here; <hi>whether an Oath taken by an Inferiour, be void or obliging,</hi> lies in that known place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. And indeed Oaths ſo ſtrictly obliging by <hi>divine Inſtitution,</hi> it is reaſonable that the <hi>irritation</hi> or <hi>obligation</hi> of them ſhould alſo from thence be determined: and by the Scripture, we freely will be tried, it being the proper Bar for judgment in things of Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. That Chapter beginneth thus; <hi>And Moſes ſpake unto the Heads of the Tribes, concerning the Children of Iſrael. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.</hi> V. 2. <hi>If any man vow a vow unto the Lord, or ſwear an Oath to bind himſelf in a bond, he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</hi> This is the general Rule, and Law of God concerning Oaths. But God is pleaſed to reſerve ſome Caſes: <hi>The caſe of a woman in her Fathers houſe,</hi> v. 3. <hi>The caſe of a woman</hi> who hath an <hi>Husband living,</hi> v. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Concerning theſe caſes, God thus determines, that if the Father of ſuch a Daughter vowing or ſwearing, <hi>v.</hi> 5. Or the Husband of ſuch a wife, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>ſhall hold his peace at her,</hi> v. 4, 7. then ſuch <hi>vows ſhall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114690:42"/> ſtand.</hi> 2. But if the Father of ſuch a Child, or the <hi>Husband of ſuch a Wife,</hi> ſhall diſallow it <hi>in the day he hears thereof,</hi> v. 5, 8. <hi>then not any of their vowes ſhall ſtand,</hi> v. 4. but ſhall be of <hi>none effect,</hi> v. 8. But v. 14. <hi>If the Husband altogether hold his peace</hi> at his wife <hi>from day to day, then he eſtabliſheth all her vowes, or all her bonds which are upon her, he confirmeth them, becauſe he held his peace at her, in the day that he heard them,</hi> v. 15. <hi>But if he ſhall any way make them void, after that he hath heard them, he ſhall bear her iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Divines do grant by <hi>Analogy,</hi> in reſpect of parity of reaſon, that the caſe is the ſame concerning Subjects in ſome caſes, as to the Oaths they take, without the knowledge or praevious conſent of their Superiors, though it be obſervable, that although <hi>Moſes</hi> at this time was ſpeaking to the <hi>Heads of the Tribes,</hi> concerning the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet he omits this caſe, as having no ſpecial Command from the Lord in it, and it will be granted that in many things wherein the Magiſtrate hath not power over his Subjects, the Husband hath power over his wife, and the Father over the Child.</p>

                  </note> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaith excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there is in every Oath, <hi>a natural and inſeparable obliging vertue,</hi> the operation of which may be hindred; but that impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being removed, the Bowl returns to its Byas, the Oath binds; and this as naturally, as water runs in its channel, when the dam is thrown down that hinders it, or a ſtone moves to its center, when the thing that ſtaied it, is removed. God himſelf cannot make a thing that is, not to have bin: The Oath having been made, hath its natural and inſeparable vertue, the operation of which, in ſome caſes indeed, the Superiors diſſent may hinder; but cannot deprive it of its obliging vertue: So that though at firſt he diſſents, and ſo ſtops the Oath from its preſent working upon the Conſcience, yet he cannot deſtroy the nature of it; and when his diſſent is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon ſecond thoughts, the Oath obligeth.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5.

Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaith truly, <hi>That if the Superior hath either conſented to the Oath before the taking of it, or at any time after the taking of it, he can never afterwards make it void, or take away its Obligation.</hi> An Oath is not a thing to be jeſted with. <hi>Ludere cum ſacris propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. To apply this to the preſent caſe of the Covenant: <hi>Is it clear, that people are under the power of Magiſtrates ſo far, as to the things of God, that the Magiſtrates may ſet up what Government in the Church they pleaſe,</hi> and under what Officers they pleaſe? Or hath not Chriſt in the Goſpel determined the Subſtantials of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to <hi>Officers,</hi> and <hi>Rules of Government?</hi> If the latter be true, Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> ſaith, none doubts, but people may covenant

               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt profeſs our ſelves no Lawyers, but may it be taken for an undoubted truth, That the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> legally aſſembled in Parliament, have no power to impoſe an Oath upon people (otherwiſe good and lawful) without the King of <hi>Englands</hi> conſent firſt had? If it be ſo, we freely ſubmit, and have nothing to ſay againſt it; but then it will only follow, that it was ſinfully impoſed and taken: not, that it doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige. If it be not ſo, the want of the Superiors conſent is not to be pleaded in the caſe</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Did his Sacred Majeſty in <hi>the day that he heard thereof, preſently</hi> and <hi>openly</hi> declare his diſallowance of it?

                  <p>Where the Abſolvers Plea from the force attending the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is conſidered, and proved vain.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1.

For many in <hi>England,</hi> there is no doubt but many Miniſters and people (though not all, nor the major part engaging) took it in ſuch a fright. But we will at preſent ſuppoſe all, <hi>viz.</hi> That both his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and many of the people took it, as being <hi>feared to it.</hi> The Queſtion ſtill is, whether ſuch Oaths once taken (however

So that (although the <hi>Scots</hi> had no power to impoſe any ſuch Oath upon their Soveraign under a penal fright, unleſs he had firſt given them that power) yet as to all the People of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe the Lords and Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> legally aſſembled in Parliament, have any ſuch priviledge to impoſe an Oath upon the people, although the King doth not conſent; we ſay (which we profeſs our ſelves not to know) in caſe they have any ſuch lawful power, the Argument from force ſignifieth nothing at all in the caſe.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114690:44"/> not yet oblige all that took it, to a juſt and religious obſervation of it? To which we ſay;</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. The Third Commandment ſaies, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that takes his Name in vain.</hi> This Commandment is further interpreted by divers Scriptures, <hi>You ſhall not ſwear by my Name falſly, neither ſhalt thou prophane the Name of the Lord thy God,</hi> Lev. 19.12. <hi>If a man vow a Vow unto the Lord, or ſwear an Oath to bind his ſoul with a Bond, he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that hath proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> Numb. 30.2. <hi>It was ſaid of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thy Oaths,</hi> Mat. 5.33. And as to the penalty; <hi>I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the Sorcerers, and againſt the Adulterers, and againſt the Falſe ſwearers,</hi> Mal. 3.5. And again, <hi>The Curſe of God ſhall enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by the Lords name, and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, and with the ſtones thereof,</hi> Zech. 5.3. It is the obſervation of <hi>Filiucius,</hi> that the Precept is negative, and therefore no pretence of force can diſcharge us from our obedience to it: Not to diſpute the force of his Argumentation, It is plain from thoſe Texts, that every man is ſeverely obliged to perform his Oaths; and the expreſs obligation of an Oath appearing from Divine Inſtitution, ſo highly <hi>oneroſa,</hi> (as the Caſuiſts ſpeak) loading the Soul with curſes that neglecteth it. It cannot but to every ſober Chriſtian appear, highly reaſonable, that before we conclude, <hi>That Oaths extorted by fear, are not obligatory,</hi> we ſhould find either from Scriptural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or Preſidents, a plain diſcharge from the obligation of them: Which we think will be very hard to find.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Yet, if we miſtake not, we ſhall find ſome Scriptural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which appear to us ſtrong evidences to the contrary: We ſhall inſtance but in two: That concerning the Spies ſent by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> whoſe ſtory we read <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2. &amp; 5. and that of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> which we have recorded, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. As to the former we read, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2. That he ſent two men to ſpie out <hi>Jericho:</hi> The King of <hi>Jerichò</hi> by ſome of his Miniſters of State, gaines intelligence, that they were come, and to what end they were come, and that they were lodged at the houſe of <hi>Rahab;</hi> he ſends Meſſengers to <hi>Rahab,</hi> to deliver them, ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that ſuch were come, but ſaies they were gone again, (while in the mean time they were hidden in the top of her houſe)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114690:45"/> ſhe comes to them before they went to bed; and <hi>v.</hi> 12. requires of them <hi>to ſwear unto her by the Lord,</hi> that as ſhe <hi>had ſhewed kindneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> ſo that when they had conquered <hi>Jericho,</hi> they would ſave alive <hi>her Father and her Mother, and her Brethren and her Siſters, and all that they had:</hi> They ſwear accordingly. In the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> you read that <hi>Jericho</hi> was <hi>taken by the Iſraelites: V.</hi> 22. <hi>Joſhua</hi> commands theſe Spies to go <hi>into the Harlots houſe,</hi> and to bring out the woman and all that ſhe had as they <hi>ſware unto her.</hi> If <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been of the Religion of our late <hi>Abſolvers,</hi> how much might they have pleaded in diſcharge of this Oath?</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>matter</hi> of it, there is an <hi>appearance</hi> of unlawfulneſs in it, becauſe of the Command of God to deſtroy the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and not to <hi>pity</hi> or <hi>spare</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was made without <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s advice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It <hi>was impoſed by an unlawful power.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. The men could not but fear, that if they had refuſed, <hi>Rahab</hi> might have diſcovered them, which had ſhe done, they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably have died. But that age it ſeems was not ſo cunning to quit themſelves of Oaths. It is the probable opinion of <hi>Magali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> that the Precept of God for deſtroying the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> was with an exception, to ſuch of them as ſhould expreſs ſignal kindneſs to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And for other things they were to learn that an Oath taken (otherwiſe lawful) was diſcharged by any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The ſecond Inſtance is that of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> The ſtory is this; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was a third Son of <hi>Joſiah.</hi> The Scripture mentioneth three Sons of that good King; <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Joſiah</hi> immediatly) <hi>Jehoiachim</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> called by his Father <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniah; Jehoahaz</hi> having reigned wickedly <hi>three moneths,</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and carried into captivity by <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he died (for ought we know) childleſs, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.32, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſetteth up in his ſtead <hi>Eliakim,</hi> a ſecond Son of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and turns his Name to <hi>Jehoiachim:</hi> he reigneth 11 years.

Son of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Brother to <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> or <hi>Jechoniah.</hi> There appears nought to the contrary, but that he was the right heir to the Crown. <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> and <hi>Jehoiachim</hi> being dead (and probably <hi>Jeconiah</hi> dead too) ſure we are he had a right to his liberty: He could neither have this Crown, nor yet his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without taking this Oath to the Uſurper the King of <hi>Babilon:</hi> he muſt elſe have alwaies lived a ſlave to a Pagan Prince, and have been in daily danger of his life, and the more, as the refuſing ſuch an Oath, would have rendered him to the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> as ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, for hatching ſome deſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the recovery of his own, and his Countreyes Liberty. He takes it. And 'tis very like that he had ſome about him of the complexion of our late <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> who might tell him, it was an Oath againſt the <hi>Lawes of Iſrael,</hi> impoſed by an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> forced upon him as a Priſoner, and therefore did not oblige. What ever the motive was, he brake it, and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 17.15. ſent <hi>Ambaſſadors into Egypt to give him horſes, and much people.</hi> But obſerve how God takes this, whether he alſo concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> Oath and Covenant was <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void.</hi> God declareth his ſenſe of it by the Prophet <hi>Ezech.</hi> chap. 17. under the Parable of <hi>two Eagles</hi> and <hi>a Vine,</hi> from v. 1. to v. 11. he expounds this Parable, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; ſequent.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114690:46"/> (notwithſtanding his Oath?) According to our new Caſuiſts the Oath was null and void, <hi>Zedekiah was a priſoner, the Jews in captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Zedekiah</hi> had never ſworn to be tributary to the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> ſurely, if it had not been to recover his rights, if he had not been afraid of death, or impriſonment, or perpetual exile, certainly he could not offend God in violating ſuch a forced Oath. But it ſeems the thoughts of God were otherwiſe; for the Prophet goes on: <hi>Shall he prosper? ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things? or ſhall he break the Covenant, and be delivered?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>V. 18. <hi>Seeing he deſpiſed the Oath, by breaking the Covenant, when lo he had given his hand, and done all theſe things, he ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. 19. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, as I live ſurely, mine Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it poſſible now that any owning the name of Divines, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Scriptures, ſhould tell us, that Oaths extorted by fear do not oblige?</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Nor have our <hi>Abſolvers</hi> any better encouragement from the ſuffrage of Divines in the caſe, whether they be <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Protestants. Azorius</hi> tels us, it is <hi>Communis ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the common ſenſe of Divines, that Oaths ſo extorted do binde in conſcience: <hi>Sanches</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Quidam antiqui,</hi> ſome old Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines did think they doe not oblige, but who they are, we cannot find.<note place="margin">Aq. 21 <hi>ae. q.</hi> 89. <hi>art.</hi> 7. <hi>reſp. ad</hi> 3.</note> Sure we are, that <hi>Aquinas, Sayrus, Azorius, Filiucius, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Al.

Some of them indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, whether the violation of ſuch Oaths be a <hi>mortal ſin,</hi> or only <hi>venial;</hi> whether they bind <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> or no (according to <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon Law</hi>) whether the Pope can abſolve in the caſe or no; but that ſuch Oathes <hi>bind in the Court of Conſcience,</hi> we finde none doubting. There is indeed in the <hi>Canon Law</hi> a caſe of a Biſhop mentioned, from whom Count <hi>Arnulph</hi> took ſome goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Church, and made to ſwear, that he would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the reſtoring of them. The Biſhops caſe was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pope,</hi> he determines <hi>the Biſhops Oath void,</hi> and diſchargeth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114690:46"/> him by a formal <hi>abſolution.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conclude, that the Pope determined the Oath void <hi>(in foro Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtico)</hi> becauſe of the force he was under. But the <hi>Gloſſator</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Canon Law, and ſo <hi>Sanches</hi> and others, determine better, that the reaſon why their <hi>Holy Father</hi> determined the <hi>Biſhops Oath</hi> void, was not becauſe of the force (under which the Biſhop was) but becauſe the matter of the Oath was unlawfull, he might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate the Churches goods, he being but a termer in them. And it ſeems that the Pope himſelf judged his caſe ſuch, that he ſtood in need of his <hi>Abſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. But to leave the Authorities of men, which we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſignifie very little to us in ſuch a caſe as this is (the obligation of an Oath reſulting from divine inſtitution.) Let us inquire what may be ſaid in reaſon, either for, or againſt the <hi>Obligation of ſuch Oaths.</hi> We never read, or heard, nor are able to phanſie more than two reaſons in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, what one does under <hi>a force, he doth not freely and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, <hi>he who by threatning forceth us to ſwear to his pleaſure, doth us an injury,</hi> and it is againſt all reaſon, that any ſhould <hi>from a wrong, raiſe up to himſelf a right.</hi> Both which reaſons have been conſidered by the Schoolmen and Caſuiſts, and determined inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. <hi>Sanches</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Sanches <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. Filiucius <hi>mor. qu. tract. cap.</hi> 6. Suarez <hi>De Jur. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> that <hi>Spontaneitas non eſt neceſſaria ad obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Juramenti.</hi> Spontaneity is not neceſſary to make an Oath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, and <hi>Filiucius</hi> tels us, <hi>coacta voluntas est voluntas;</hi> A will compelled is a will ſtill: <hi>Aliquis timoratus poteſt velle jurare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez;</hi> one under a fear may will an act of ſwearing.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. And for the latter reaſon, it is determined of no value; becauſe the injury done us by men, cannot diſcharge the obligation reſulting from an oath unto God. <hi>Dous jusjurandum ſibi delatum non extorquet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Azorius</hi>) God doth no man injury by forcing him, and hence they determine,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That a naked promiſe made upon a force doth not oblige, becauſe that is onely made to men, and no obligation to God reſulteth from it, but an Oath doth.</hi> Though we muſt confeſs, rather to agree with <hi>Azorius,</hi> who ſaith ſuch promiſes do bind, <hi>jure naturali &amp; divino,</hi> by a natural and divine right, but not by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Canon Law.

                  </note> That an Oath added to a Promiſe ſo forced from us, is not <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114690:47"/> of an obligation, but introductive of an <hi>obligation.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a promiſe two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it contains an <hi>aſsertion or propoſition</hi> relating to matter of fact to be after done by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In its <hi>proper form,</hi> as it is our engagement to our Brother, tending to his advantage: The Oath added to a promiſe forced from us, they ſay doth not confirm the promiſe in its proper form, not oblige us to do the thing, as the doing of it is advantageous to our brother; but it obligeth us to make good the aſſertion or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. The truth is, art Oath obligeth by vertue of Gods Law, and the ſame Law of God muſt provide exceptions to diſcharge the obligation of it. The Word of God no where ſaith, that the injury done us by our neighbour, or the want of perfect liberty when we do the Act, ſhall diſcharge us from the performance of it. We ſhall further offer ſeverall reaſons againſt this novel Divinity concerning the nullity of forced Oaths: Seven or eight we ſhall inſtance in, moſt of which have been pleaded by Divines, and we ſhall give them their honour as we mention them.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Firſt in all Reaſon, an <hi>Oath into which a man is cheated,</hi> is <hi>leſſe obligatory</hi> than one by fear extorted. <hi>Sanches</hi> gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>quia dolus aufert conſenſum,</hi> a man in ſuch a caſe cannot be ſaid to have conſented; but that ſuch an oath is obligatory, is plain from the inſtance of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> upon which we have the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the <hi>Princes of the Congregation,</hi> Joſ. 2.19. (when the cheat was diſcover'd) delivered in theſe words, <hi>We have ſworn unto them by the Lord, therefore we may not touch them, becauſe of the Oath which we ſware unto them:</hi> God himſelf reſolves this caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. puniſhing all <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt with three years Famine, for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Fathers Oath, and then <hi>Saul</hi> eminently, in the Sacrifice of ten of his Sons to appeaſe Gods wrath for the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Oath. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Oaths extorted by fear much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Secondly, <hi>The injuries and infirmities of men cannot diſcharge any obligation upon us unto God. But fear concludes onely, the injury and infirmity of men.</hi> We find the Schoolmen and Caſuiſts generally agreeing in this.</p>
               <p>That from every promiſory Oath, there reſults a double <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> The one to men whom the promiſe concerneth; the other to <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Sacred Name is invoked. <hi>Aquinas, Sanches, Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114690:47"/> Sayrus, Filiucius,</hi> all agree in this, and moſt of them uſe it as an Argument to prove the Obligation of ſuch Oaths. Mens inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in forcing us, may diminiſh the Obligation to them, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acquit us from our debt to God.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Thirdly, Every Oath which is <hi>licitum &amp; poſſibile</hi> (lawful and <hi>poſſible) doth oblige, but fear</hi> doth not make an Oath either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>impoſſible: Baldwin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> with many others urge this Argument.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. Every Oath to which a man conſents (if otherwiſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) is (notwithſtanding any pretence of fear) obliging; <hi>Baldwin</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> both urge this: The latter urgeth well, that the perſon ſo ſwearing, hath his choyce, whether he will ſwear, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the penalty like to be inflicted upon him for refuſing the Oath; the will cannot be forced: He that thus ſwears (ſaith Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi>) chuſeth what at that time appeared beſt to him, and is therefore bound by it: <hi>Gregorius Sayrus</hi> agrees in the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. Fifthly, Becauſe an Oath (notwithſtanding any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of force) may be kept <hi>without any hazard to a mans Salvation.</hi> This Argument is urged by <hi>Filiucius,</hi> the <hi>Gloſsator</hi> upon the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> It ſeems it was a Rule in Divinity in former times (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgotten now) <hi>That every Oath which any man had made, and could keep without the hazard of his eternal ſalvation, he was obliged to keep:</hi> In this Rule alſo agree <hi>Sanchez, Suarez, Molina,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. Sixthly, <hi>Becauſe the performance of a Promiſe ratified by ſuch an Oath,</hi> is a <hi>vertuous action,</hi> ſuppoſing the matter of the promiſe lawful, though it be not neceſſary, yet when we have promiſed it, the performance becomes <hi>actus virtutis,</hi> for no act <hi>individuo</hi> is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whatever it may be <hi>in specie. Sanches</hi> ſaith truly, that it is not neceſſary to make an Oath oblige, that the matter be neceſſary: it is enough if it be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> and if no more, yet an Oath makes it neceſſary as to us, and a Promiſe in ſuch a matter, ſaith <hi>Cajetan</hi> (whoſe Argument this is, is a vertuous Act, and ſuch muſt the fulfilling of it be.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. Seventhly, <hi>A multiplication of ineffectual cauſes, though it implieth an addition to their number, yet it adds nothing to their weight,</hi> ſaith <hi>Filiucius.</hi> Here are two cauſes in the preſent caſe, which may be pretended, why ſuch Oaths ſhould not oblige. 1. <hi>The Injury.</hi> 2. <hi>The Fear.</hi> Both theſe are inoperative and ineffectual ſingly; 1. <hi>Fear</hi> alone will not nulliſie an Oath (as we ſaid before) an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114690:48"/> Oath into which a lawful power doth fright his Subjects by penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is yet obligatory, and granted ſo by all. 2. The injury of an uſurped power, will not do it, without <hi>fear.</hi> Caſuiſts agree, that Oaths (otherwiſe lawful) impoſed by unlawful powers (if once taken) do oblige. Now it is againſt reaſon, that theſe two ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſes ſhould joyntly do what it is granted, that they cannot ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and apart: This is <hi>Filiucius</hi> his Argument.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. Eightly, <hi>Juſtice requires, that a condition</hi> (lawful to be performed by me) <hi>ſhould be made good to another,</hi>

               <p n="22">§. 22. Ninthly (ſaith Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) We ought <hi>alwaies to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our carnal wiſdom and reaſon, as contrary to purity of heart, and peace of Conſcience.</hi> But what can be called wiſdom of the fleſh, if this be not, to oppoſe our own reaſon without any warrant of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to the expreſs and ſevere Letter of Scripture, concerning the Obligation of Oaths.</p>

               <p n="24">§. 24. Upon theſe and the like Reaſons, we (with the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Divines of all ſorts, and in all ages) conclude againſt the <hi>Scio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> and <hi>Novelliſts</hi> in Divinity, of this preſent age, <hi>That Oaths ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by fear,</hi> are (if otherwiſe lawful, notwithſtanding ſuch frights, or pretended force) <hi>obligatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. In which Concluſion Divines are ſo highly agreed, that they not only determine, the Traveller bound to pay the ſum of money, which he hath ſworn to pay to a Thief, for the ſparing of his life; but alſo <hi>That he who is juſtly impriſoned, and in danger, yea, certain to loſe his life</hi> (if he return to his Keepers hands, having ſealed his Parol with his Oath, that he might have a liberty of breathing in the open Air) <hi>is bound in Conſcience to</hi> return: Yea, the moſt (though <hi>Vasquez, Corruvias,</hi> and ſome others diſſent)

               <p n="5">§. 5. A <hi>Fourth</hi> way by which the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot of an Oath may be untied, according to the Schoolmen, is by the <hi>Ceſſation of the matter;</hi> in which caſe, all <hi>Caſuiſts, Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> judge the Obligation to ceaſe.

                  </note> we will refer our ſelves to Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and but tranſlate part of his excellent determination in the caſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (Saith he) <hi>There can be no ſuch releaſe in Vows; in Oaths confirming humane Pacts, Covenants, and Bargains, there may. The reaſon of the difference is, becauſe Vows are made to God, as to one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now we ſhewed before, that the Covenant as to the firſt and ſecond Branch of it, did partake of the nature of a <hi>Vow,</hi> it was <hi>ſponſio facta Deo in rebus Dei,</hi> a Promiſe made to God, as well as to men, <hi>in the things of God,</hi> relating immediatly to his <hi>Worſhip and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, (ſaith Dr. <hi>Sanderſon) If the Oath taken</hi> be [<hi>in gratiam alterius</hi>] i. e. <hi>for the honour, profit, or commodity of another, or the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an homage to another, it doth not oblige, unleſs that other to whom we ſwear, accepts and confirms it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, (ſaith he) <hi>If he or they to whom ſuch Oath is made, for his or their profit and advantage, will have it ſtand good, no third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can diſcharge us from the obligation of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, (ſaith he) <hi>If the perſon to whom we ſwear will releaſe us
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114690:50"/> the Oath doth not oblige us after ſuch Releaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, (ſaith he) <hi>The Oath is in ſuch caſe only diſcharged ſo far as he doth releaſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, (ſaith he) <hi>The Releaſe of any Party in an Oath, only takes away the Obligation of it as to his particular Intereſt, but prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth no third Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. From the <hi>Grave Determinations</hi> of this Learned man, by a <hi>review</hi> of what we have already ſaid in our Second <hi>Chap.</hi> concerning the nature of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> it is no hard thing to conclude, what Lamentable Divinity they publiſh, that tell us, that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any man or men, to diſcharge us from the Obligation of the <hi>Oath of God</hi> which is upon us.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114690:51"/> our <hi>Brethren</hi> will not ſay, that an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> if (which God forbid) any ſuch ſhould hereafter be, will diſcharge thoſe that have taken that <hi>Oath,</hi> from the obſervance of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning Dr. <hi>Sanderſons</hi> 2, 3, and 4th. Determinations, there may be ſome queſtion: <hi>If a man ſwears to another for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we are apt to believe the Oath binds in Conſcience,</hi> though <hi>he to whom we ſwear, knows not of it, much leſs apertly accepts and ratifies it.</hi> Suppoſe a man ſwears to <hi>breed up his Child to Learning,</hi> or to a Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we believe the Oath will bind, though the Child doth not like it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There may alſo appear ſome doubt about the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him, to whom we ſwear, <hi>to releaſe us in whole or in part,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as we have ſaid before, from every ſuch <hi>Oath</hi> there reſulteth a double Obligation; 1. To man. 2. To God. Now it doth not ſeem reaſonable, That man ſhould diſcharge Gods Debts. Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> (aware of this exception) anſwers, <hi>That in a promiſe made,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ib. prael. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>meerly far the advantage of another, and confirmed by an Oath, God is only invoked, as a witneſs of the truth of our hearts in promiſing, and challenged as a revenger, in caſe we violate our Faith ſo confirmed, but if the Party releaſeth us, our Faith is not violated, ſo that no injury is done to God in it.</hi> We think this as much as can be ſaid, whether ſufficient or no, we will not here enquire, this not at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our caſe.</p>
               <p>We conclude then, that as we can ſee no errour in the <hi>Efficient, material, formal</hi> or <hi>final</hi> cauſes of this Oath of God which is upon us, ſufficient to diſcharge us from the Obligation of it (conſidering things as they are now ſtated, and that the Oath is taken) ſo we cannot believe it in the power of any (ſave God alone) by <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, irritation, commutation,</hi> or <hi>relaxation,</hi> to diſcharge us from an endeavour to perform it. The <hi>Compaſs</hi> of that term, <hi>endeavour,</hi> remaineth yet to be meaſured by us, with <hi>a Reed from the Sanctuary,</hi> and that ſhall be our laſt Task.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning the Limitations of the Covenant, common to all Premiſſory Oaths, or particularly relating to this. What endeavour as to the mattter of the Covenant, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. SUch is the Soveraign power of God over all, ſuch the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which the Divide Law hath reſerved to Superiors, ſuch our own ignorance and infirmity (of which yet in due time we may be convinced) and ſuch the mutability of humane affairs, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines reaſonably ſay, that to all <hi>promiſſory Oaths,</hi> certain conditions (though not expreſt) are yet neceſſarily to be ſuppoſed, <hi>viz. Si De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us voluerit,</hi> if God will (otherwiſe the performance will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) 2. <hi>If lawfully I may:</hi> Otherwiſe the Oath will be <hi>vinculum Iniquitatis,</hi> and make us Debtors to Hell, 3. <hi>Saving the right of my Superior:</hi> For as we ſaid before, God hath reſerved to ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, a power of <hi>irritation</hi> (or <hi>ſuſpending</hi> rather) ſuch Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 4. <hi>If things continue in their preſent ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. As the third muſt not be underſtood otherwiſe than we have before proved; ſo the laſt muſt not be taken in its Latitude; For then (ſuch are the contingencies and viciſſitudes of humane affairs) that very few promiſſory Oaths relating to things to be done at any diſtance of time, would be found obliging. It is true, if the ſtate of the caſe be ſo altered, that it will be <hi>ſin</hi> for us to fulfil our Oaths, the Oath will not oblige, ſuch is the inſtance Caſuiſts give of an Oath, to give a ſword to one, who before he receives it from us, proves mad. 2. And <hi>when the ſtate of the caſe is ſo altered, that the plain end of the Oath, and the expectation upon which it is founded, appears fruſtrate</hi> (the Oath being only made to a Creature, for his or her advantage) it may be a queſtion, whether the Oath obligeth yea or no? Such is that other Caſe put by Caſuiſts, <hi>Where one hath ſworn marriage to another, and before the time of Marriage comes, he diſcerns ſhe hath been defiled by another</hi> (in which caſe his refuſal to marry, is little other, than a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, allowed by Gods Law in caſe of Adultery, as this is after
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114690:52"/> ſuch a Contract in Gods ſight) But none of theſe will at preſent gratifie our Abſolvers.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Some therefore have obſerved the expreſs Limitations in the terms of the Covenant: 1. <hi>We will endeavour,</hi> 2. <hi>In our Callings and Places.</hi> 3. <hi>So far as lawfully we may.</hi> And God forbid the terms ſhould have been any other. Far be it from us to aſſert, that a man is tied by his Oath, beyond his <hi>endeavour,</hi> yea, and <hi>lawful endeavour,</hi> and in his <hi>Calling</hi> too. We ſay that the utmoſt that any conſcientious Chriſtian is by the Oath tied to, is, <hi>his utmoſt lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in his Calling,</hi> as a <hi>Parliament-man,</hi> as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> as a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> as a <hi>private perſon, according to his preſent capacity or future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> and if by endeavouring, honeſtly and lawfully he cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his end, it is his duty, to ſit down, and commit his ſoul and his cauſe to God, who doubtleſs will accept the ſincerity of his heart. Only we hope it will not be pleaded in Bar to the lawfulneſs of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in this caſe, that it is not lawful to endeavour if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhall by a Law be eſtabliſhed: For it was never thought yet unlawful, lawfully to endeavour the annulling, and regular repeal of a Law, which was found grievous to the Subjects outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, much leſs to his Conſcience (as any Law muſt be after an Oath to the contrary, as to the matter of the Law.) This being foreprized, our Brethren and we are agreed, as to this Limitation. And we freely acknowledge ourſelves obliged, either actively to do, what Lawes require, or like Chriſtians, to ſuffer the penalties which they inflict: Than which, nothing more was ever pleaded as the duty of good Subjects.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. We do therefore conclude, profeſſing, that we do believe it the duty of every conſcientious private Chriſtian, who hath taken the Covenant, when once he hath endeavoured what in him lies, in all things (lawful to be done by him) for the obtaining the ends of the Covenant, as to the Reformation of the Church; If at laſt he ſhould be ſo unhappy, as to ſee all his endeavours fruſtrated, and (to put the caſe at the worſt, which we hope will never be) he ſhould at laſt, ſee Popery ſet up (<hi>i. e.</hi> the higheſt corruption in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Adminiſtrations) to ſit down, and mourn before the Lord for it, but not to make any reſiſtance to the Lawful Magiſtrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the <hi>Ordinance of God:</hi> We hope none would ſay in ſuch a caſe, he were obliged to own Popery, or that he might do it, but he is unqueſtionably bound to ſuffer as a wel-doer, rather than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Civil Peace (What hath <hi>Peter</hi> to do with the Sword?)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114690:52"/> And if this be our ſenſe of his duty in ſo high a caſe, every one will conclude us (we hope) of that mind in caſe of the old <hi>Prelacy,</hi> which we are told is the great Bar to <hi>Popery,</hi> whatever elſe is to be ſaid againſt it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is a ſleighty notice taken of a Late Pamphlet, wrote by one Mr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> called, <hi>The Covenant diſcharged;</hi> and it is proved, that in ſtead of his finding the Snare bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as be ſaith, he hath but reſolved to break the Bonds, and to caſt the Cords behind him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. WE had thought our work had been done, and ſufficient Anſwer given, not only to what our <hi>Abſolvers</hi> had ſaid, but alſo to what they reaſonably could ſay: But while theſe ſheets were in the Preſs, we have ſeen a new Pamphlet; <hi>Qualem procul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubio mundus literatus nunquam prius vidit, nec unquam poſthac viſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus est.</hi> The Author hath done well to tell us, it was wrote from his Study at <hi>Chinkford in Eſſex,</hi> we ſhould elſe have been ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, as to have thought it had come from ſome other place; but he hath neglected to tell us, what Books are in that Study, for we cannot in any of our Studies, find any wrote, either by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whoſe Divinity will agree with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Poſitions.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. We do not think our ſelves beholden to the Author, for his promiſed forbearance of Paſſion, for beſides that, he now and then beſtows upon us a <hi>prophane Scoffe</hi> (according to the proportion of his faculty that way) as where he tels us, that <hi>the Faith of removing and ſetling Mountains are two Gifts, the latter of which we want,</hi> &amp;c. In very deed the Author hath conſulted himſelf, in not being too free with his paſſion, according to the Poets Caution, <q>Carpere vel noli noſtra, vel ede tua.</q> intending to publiſh ſuch a piece as this to the world, he ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to take heed what meaſure he meted to others, leaſt it ſhould be meted to him again, we think he is liable enough to have it <hi>even preſſed down and running over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. In divers things we confeſs he hath ſpoken truth: 1. <hi>As
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114690:53"/> to himſelf,</hi> in what he ſaies, <hi>p.</hi> 57. intending to batter the Covenant, <hi>he hath made his approaches at a reaſonable</hi> (indeed unreaſonable) <hi>diſtance,</hi> ſuch a diſtance, that no ſhot hath come near it. 2. <hi>As to the matter;</hi> as where he ſaith, 1. That none can releaſe a <hi>Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> but the <hi>Parties</hi> with whom it is <hi>contracted:</hi> That <hi>where an Oath is made to God, ſo that he is Judge and Party,</hi> only <hi>God can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it,</hi> p. 14. And <hi>p.</hi> 15. He <hi>would not be thought to plead for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power in any, to diſcharge men from Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. which would be enough for us, who have already proved, that the Covenant was <hi>Sponſio facta Deo in rebus Dei,</hi> a Vow made (though at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of others) to God, as to the things which concern God; and giving unto God a right to exact the performance from us; as alſo, That it was a mutual ſtipulation with our Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> with our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and according to Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s own Doctrine, if there were nothing of a Vow in it, yet all Parties muſt releaſe: So that what he ſaies more, is to no purpoſe, becauſe he argues <hi>ex ignoratione Elenchi,</hi> and lamentably miſtakes the nature of the thing of which he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But becauſe though he ſeems to grant this, yet up and down his Book, he ſcatters ſuggeſtions of another nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed maintains ſuch Poſitions as we are ſure Dr. <hi>Gawden</hi> durſt not juſtifie, and runs into ſo abominable miſtakes, as if once believed by others, would make all Oaths no ſtronger than ſtrawes; we will add a few animadverſions, upon what he ſaith, intreating our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hereafter to bring forth other Champions, who may bring more credit to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than we conceive this Author in a capacity to do (if we may gueſs at <hi>Leonem ex ungue.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. As to our Brother <hi>Crofton,</hi> whom he mentions in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, we conceive him of age, and therefore ſhall only deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice; 1. That the Author can produce no Vote of Parliament in his terms, <hi>viz. That the Kings Conceſſions were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to eſtabliſh a well-grounded Peace.</hi> The Vote paſſed <hi>Die Martis,</hi> 5 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1648, in theſe terms:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved upon the Queſtion, That the Anſwers of the King, to the Propoſitions of both Houſes, are a</hi> GROUND, <hi>for the Houſes to proceed upon, for the ſetling the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this to <hi>ſufficient to eſtabliſh?</hi> But ſuppoſe this Abſolver had not ſtumbled here, but the Vote had been as he would have it—Why then (if you will believe him) the ſame power that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Covenant, tacitly diſcharged it. For — <hi>The continuation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114690:53"/> of Biſhops was included</hi> (in thoſe Conceſſions we ſuppoſe.) This is again a moſt impudent falſhood. For the King in termes granted as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And we will likewiſe for three years confirm by Act of Parliament the Form of Church-government you have preſented to be uſed for the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Kings Conceſſions printed 1648. pag. 2.</note> Provided that his Majeſty, and thoſe of his Judgement, or any others who in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot ſubmit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not in the mean time obliged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that a free conſultation and debate be had with the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the mean time (twenty of his Majeſties nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and his two Houſes how the ſaid Church-Government, and Form of publike Worſhip after the ſaid time may be ſetled, or ſooner, if diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be agreed.</q> We wonder where <hi>Epiſcopacy was here included?</hi> Sure we are, the <hi>Propoſitions ſent</hi> were for the utter aboliſhing of it. By this firſt Eſſay, the Reader may judge what to concluded M. <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi>'s aſſertions, and to ſhew that that Parliament never intended to annull the bond of the Covenant. They no ſooner met, <hi>anno</hi> 1659. but ordered it to be hung up before their eyes in the Parliament Houſe for a continual monitor to them. It was urged by Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> &amp; doubtleſs highly prevailed, both with the conſciences of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and alſo of the friends of the Long Parliament, to further the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of his Sacred Majeſty, therefore ſurely it was not annulled by that Parliament, 1648. in any mens underſtanding, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the peculiar intellect of this Abſolver.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. In the firſt Page of his Book we cannot but take notice, that though his zeal appears high for the Religion of an Oath, it muſt not (he ſaies) be <hi>impoſed without great Prudence,</hi> nor <hi>taken without great care,</hi> &amp;c. nor <hi>handled without great fear,</hi> &amp;c. yet he hath omitted one main thing, <hi>viz.</hi> this, Nor <hi>violated without juſt warrant from Gods Word;</hi> Let that be put in, and we are ſo far agreed.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. In his ſecond Page he ſeems to be wonderfully free, he will grant us (by way of ſuppoſition) all but one point; he will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to have been, 1. <hi>Impoſed by a lawful authority.</hi> 2. <hi>Not defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in Circumſtances,</hi> 3. <hi>Clear from Ambiguity.</hi> 4. <hi>Perfect in form.</hi> 5. <hi>Pious in the End.</hi> 6. <hi>Fair in the manner, without fraud, violence, with deliberation, and conſent.</hi> 7. <hi>As to the matter lawful.</hi> Only he will not grant us, <hi>That it cannot be releaſed by any humane act or power.</hi> That it may not be ſaid, <hi>This man hath made us rich,</hi> we will yield him all again, but the ſeventh, and if he will not give us <hi>that,</hi> we will buy it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114690:54"/> of him, at a full price of Reaſon and Argument, (ſuch as ſhall be currant with all divines) we will ſuppoſe that at firſt, <hi>it was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a lawful authority.</hi> 2. <hi>That there was a defect in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi> 3. <hi>That as to ſome parts there was Ambiguity.</hi> 4. That <hi>it was not perfect in the Form.</hi> 5. That the <hi>End was not pious.</hi> 6. <hi>That there might be fraud or force, or too much haſte in the taking, or impoſing it,</hi> and yet (what the Books in <hi>Chinkeford</hi> Study ſay we cannot tell) our Divinity Books tell us, that an <hi>Oath</hi> taken (notwithſtanding all theſe) <hi>will oblige.</hi> As for what he hugs ſo faſt that he will not grant it us, though it were enough to tell him, all learned men that ever we heard of, would; yet we will endeavour to unclaſp his hands, and try if we can get it by fair wreſtling with this great Champion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſured, he will refuſe upon any fair ground to try a fall with us upon this iſſue, and that all Divines, of judgement, will hiſs at him that doth it. But he tells us, Page 2. <hi>That he will by ſufficient arguments and teſtimonies prove that the ſame ſpecifical power, or an higher than that which impoſed this Vow upon us, may releaſe us from the ſame either tacitly or expreſly.</hi> When he hath done that, he muſt prove too that they have done it.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. 'Tis Reaſon we ſhould liſten to this great undertaking, only we deſire the Reader to take notice, that himſelf, both here, and elſewhere calls it a <hi>Vow,</hi> which according to all Divines <hi>is a ſolemn promiſe made to God in the things of God.</hi> From ſuch an obligation as this he undertakes to prove our diſcharge, and yet as he tels us, p. 14. <hi>In thoſe Oaths where God is judge and party there are none that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from the binding power but God alone;</hi> We would fain know whether in a <hi>Vow</hi> God be not <hi>Judge and Party;</hi> and what Divines ever ſaid otherwiſe? Or to whom a <hi>Vow</hi> is made if not to God? And then let this Author adviſe how to reconcile himſelf to himſelf, and he will be more likely to agree with us.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The foundation of his Argumentation is, <hi>The power of men in ſome caſes to releaſe the Bond of an Oath to their Neighbours.</hi> The truth of which we ſhall declare in the words of Dr. <hi>Sanderſon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sanderſon De Jur. prom. prael.</hi> 7 §. 7. p. 229, 230.</note> Having firſt determined that <hi>none can diſcharge us from Vows.</hi> He tells us 2. That <hi>if we ſwear for the good and advantage of our brother (meerly.)</hi> viz. <hi>with respect to his ſingle honour, obedience, profit,</hi> &amp;c. if he, <hi>to whom we ſwear,</hi> (for ſuch his ſole <hi>profit,</hi> and <hi>advantage) will releaſe us, we are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from our Oath, and not bound in conſcience to fulfill it:</hi> The Reaſon is, <hi>becauſe our Brother may yield us his right, and ſo we have paid the debt, which done, we are not obliged.</hi> As for <hi>God; in an Oath made</hi> (praeciſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114690:54"/> in favorem alterius) <hi>meerly for our Brothers advantage, God is only concerned as a witneſs of our fidelity, and a revenger in caſe we be not faithfull, but if our brother hath diſcharged us, we are not unfaithful, in not doing the thing, and ſo no tranſgreſſors before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But although we have ſaid this before, and now again to let our Abſolver know we have no ſuch deſire (as he ſuggeſts, p. 2.) to ſnare peoples conſciences, yet we do not think any thing of this is proved from the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Servant, Gen.</hi> 24. which he makes the whole buſineſs of his Book, how fitly will appear by giving the Reader a juſt view of the Text.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. In the 24. of <hi>Geneſis, Abraham</hi> calls the <hi>eldeſt Servant of his houſe,</hi> and bids him <hi>put his</hi> hand under his thigh, and he would make him ſwear, That he ſhould not take a Wife for <hi>Iſaac</hi> of the Daughters of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt go unto my Country, and to my Kindred, and take a Wife to my Son Iſaac.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>And the Servant ſaid unto him, peradventure the Woman will not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow me unto this Land, muſt I needs bring thy Son again unto the Land from which thou camest? And Abraham ſaid, beware that thou bring not my Son thither again.</hi> v. 8. <hi>And if the Woman will not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow thee, then thou ſhalt be clear from my Oath,</hi> &amp;c. After all this, v. 9. <hi>The Servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his Maſter, and ſware to him concerning that matter.</hi> Here we have <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> diſcovering to his Servant a deſign he had to ſend him for a Wife for his Son, and for ſecurity of his faithfulneſs, that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put an Oath upon him, that he ſhould not take a Canaanite, but one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Kindred. The Servant fearing the Oath of God, deſires before he ſware, fully to know his ſenſe, that he might not ſwear a thing either <hi>impoſſible</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> it might have been impoſſible to have brought her without her conſent, to be ſure it had been unlawful (for two words muſt go to make the lawfulneſs of ſuch bargains,) <hi>Abraham</hi> tells him that in that caſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt be free from the Oath. i. e.</hi> My deſign is not to engage thee in ſuch a caſe, nor indeed could he engage him. After this the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant takes the Oath.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. Now (Reader!) what doſt thou think this ſhould prove? That which it naturally proves is this; <hi>That an Oath doth not oblige contrary to the declared ſenſe of the impoſers before it is taken.</hi> But what is this to the thing in queſtion? 'Tis brought by this <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> to prove that <hi>Abraham had power to diſcharge his Servant of his Oath when he had taken it;</hi> yea, and this is again, and again, and again repeated,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114690:55"/> and made the foundation of all the diſcourſe by vertue of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>quodlibetical</hi> abilities, when as there is not a tittle in the text looking this way, the paſſage being only an explication of the ſenſe of an Oath before it was taken; we cannot but believe, that either the <hi>Printer</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> hath abuſed the World, in telling it, that ſuch lamentable ſtuff as this is, was atteſted by Dr. <hi>Gawden.</hi> We are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to think what opinion will by ſuch ſcriblings as theſe be begot in the World, of the <hi>Church of England?</hi> We ſhall need ſay no more we hope to any thing he urgeth upon this foundation. He tells us, <hi>Jacob</hi> might have diſcharged <hi>Eſau</hi> too of his Oath, nor (though he hath not proved it) will we deny it, it being only made to a <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>for his advantage,</hi> which is nothing as to our caſe; he promiſed us more examples, but <hi>p.</hi> he tells us he hath none. Yet, <hi>p.</hi> 7. he hath found out, ſuch a one as it is, and tells us (but take heed of believing him good Reader!) That Mr. <hi>Crofton ſaith, that we had our firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for the Covenant from the Holy League;</hi> He that will read a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in <hi>Grimſtons tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>French Hiſtory,</hi> p. 823, 824. will quickly underſtand the nature of the <hi>Holy League.</hi> And though this <hi>Gentleman</hi> betrayeth no ſuch depth of Judgement, yet we know our Brother <hi>Crofton</hi> is able to diſtinguiſh betwixt a <hi>League made by a pack of Popiſh Nobles,</hi> not <hi>lawfully Convened,</hi> and <hi>that for the raiſing of a war againſt their lawful Soveraign;</hi> and <hi>whoever elſe ſhould oppoſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deſigns.</hi> And a Solemn <hi>Covenant</hi> made by the <hi>Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons legally aſſembled in Parliament, for the reformation of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c.

In the next place, he argues from the <hi>abuſe of the Covenant,</hi> here he tells us of the <hi>aboliſhing</hi> the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> the <hi>deſtruction of the Temple,</hi> &amp;c. when they were abuſed; he ſhould have done well to have told us of the aboliſhing of a <hi>Vow taken,</hi> becauſe ſome that took it did not keep it, then he had ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe; we ſhall not meddle with his quibling about the <hi>unbleſt effects</hi> of the Covenant, we are ſure that it hath had ſome <hi>bleſt effects,</hi> and we are ſure that his talk of <hi>aboliſhing the obligation of an Oath lawful as to its matter,</hi> &amp;c. is a parcell of <hi>unbleſt Divinity</hi> if it be good ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. For his next Argument, fetcht from <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch,</hi> &amp;c. if he had underſtood that Scripture with the Context, he would have ſpared that inſtance where <hi>Solomon</hi> (having inſtituted a Dialogue between his fleſh and ſpirit) brings in the fleſh
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114690:55"/> giving him that ſaving advice, we are yet to learn how any can be <hi>Righteous overmuch. Solomon</hi> tells us there what his heart ſaid unto him in the daies of his vanity, not what is our duty.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. We ſee nothing more in his Tract till he comes to his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he highly triumpheth, That an <hi>Oath is no more than a Bond,</hi> where are parties, and a witneſs. The taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> he ſaies, <hi>p.</hi> 14. is a <hi>bringing of the trial into Gods Court.</hi> Here he tells us, that in ſome <hi>Oaths God is a party, and a Judge too. And from ſuch Oaths he is ſo juſt as to tell us, none but God can releaſe us. But he will have the Covenant to be ſuch an Oath where God is only a Judge,</hi> (he forgot his being a witneſs too) <hi>not a party;</hi> (and it muſt be ſo becauſe he ſaies ſo, for he adds not a word to prove it;) To omit his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent diſcourſe of Aſſertory Oaths, <hi>p.</hi> 15. (which is wild enough,) He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>That in promiſory Oaths</hi> (ſuch as he confeſſeth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be) <hi>the Party ſworn ſtands continually in Gods Court, and is upon continual trial till he or they that put him upon trial are willing to withdraw, and ſo he ſaies we are at this time releaſed from the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Queſtion, <hi>How doth this appear? The ſame powers that impoſed it are willing to put us upon no further trial.</hi> p. 18. He diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth between making a Covenant <hi>before God, and with God;</hi> and tells us <hi>there are but two waies now of making a Covenant with God.</hi> 1. In the Sacraments. 2. By <hi>Vows.</hi> p. 19. He diſtinguiſheth betwixt <hi>taking an Oath willingly;</hi> and taking it ſpontaneouſly, <hi>p.</hi> 19, 20. To reſolve the queſtion, How the <hi>Parliament men, who have taken it, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed?</hi> He wipes the Enquirers mouth with an Egge ſhell, telling us, That every <hi>Parliament man</hi> hath a <hi>private, as well as publike capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and if the <hi>Parliament</hi> repeal the <hi>Ordinance for the Covenant,</hi> it is then <hi>Void,</hi> and Conſcience is diſcharged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To all which a ſhort anſwer will ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſay, that an Oath is <hi>Lex privata,</hi> a private Law, which Creatures lay upon themſelves, or upon one another; The tranſgreſſion of which is indeed highly cognoſcible before the Judge of the whole Earth, who in every Oath is invoked, as a witneſs, and as a Judge and Revenger of our violation of our faith. 2. In Oaths which are meerly to aſſert truths, or confirm contracts between man and man, wherein we make no bargain with God to do ought which immediately concerns his worſhip and glory; God indeed is only invoked as a ſwift witneſs, and as a ſevere judge, but is not a party, we only promiſe to men for their advantage. 3. <hi>We deny the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be meerly ſuch,</hi> it was partly a <hi>Vow,</hi> partly a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114690:56"/> both with God and men, as we have already ſhewed, we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what makes a <hi>Vow</hi> if it be not this, that it is a <hi>promiſe to God, as to the things of God.</hi> When <hi>Abraham lifted up his hands</hi> to the moſt <hi>high God, poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, that he would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the King of Sodom,</hi> Gen. 14.22. <hi>We beleeve he made a Vow,</hi> and none but God could releaſe him, yet this was not purely <hi>in rebus Dei.</hi> We think they have loſt their common ſenſe that ſay, thoſe do not vow that <hi>ſolemnly lift up their hands to God, promiſing an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fulfil his Commandments.</hi> 4. Nor doth it at all hinder, that the <hi>Parliament firſt commanded it,</hi> and then it was taken, for on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders part this ſtill was a <hi>perfect Vow.</hi> 2. On the <hi>peoples part</hi> it was ſtill a <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> as well as <hi>with men; With God;</hi> as to the things in it which concern Gods worſhip and glory immediately: <hi>With men;</hi> as to other things, If the Command of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in a <hi>Critical</hi> notion, hinder it (as to thoſe commanded) from being ſtrictly called a <hi>Vow,</hi> it yet remains a <hi>Covenant with God</hi> confirmed by an <hi>Oath.</hi> There are examples enough in Scripture of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> commanding people to make and renew <hi>Covenants with God,</hi> and of ſuch ſpontaneous Covenants; ſo that it is falſe, that it was meerly an Oath <hi>before God,</hi> it was a <hi>Covenant with God.</hi> 5. 'Tis falſe that he ſaith, that a people can make a Covenant <hi>with God</hi> only two waies: 1. <hi>In the Sacraments;</hi> 2. <hi>Spontaneouſly.</hi> They may be commanded by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> to do it, and do it in ſuch obedience. Nor have any power when it is done to releaſe them as to what concerns God, <hi>Ez.</hi> 10.3.5. There is a preſident of ſuch a Covenant made <hi>with God</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Ezra.</hi> 6. It is true, we can do no action unwillingly, but we may do ſomthing not <hi>freely</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpontaneouſly;</hi> But ſuppoſe we have once (whether ſpontaneouſly or no) made a Covenant <hi>with God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by <hi>oath;</hi> we are bound by it, and God only can releaſe it, for there is a debt accruing to God. 7. The Parliament may indeed by rheir Act hinder others, not engaged, from engaging, or at leaſt forbear their obliging men, yet free, to engage. But to ſay, that any Act of men can diſcharge the debt already contracted to God is ſuch Divinity as needs none to confute it.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. We do therefore conclude, that this <hi>Theologaſter</hi> hath hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this weighty ſubject <hi>weakly,</hi> and <hi>imperfectly</hi> enough (as he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, <hi>p.</hi> 2.) if nevertheleſs (we having now diſcovered his failings) any be provoked to handle it, better and more like a divine, we ſhall be willing to hear what he ſaith: In the mean time we leave Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to imitate the good example (as he calls it) of that holy

               <head>A Poſtſcript to the ingenuous Reader.</head>
               <p>REader, Leaſt any ſhould put a miſinterpretation upon what we have ſaid, we have thought fit to let thee know, that we have not ſeen our Papers ſince the third or fourth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, ſince which time (thou knoweſt) is come out His <hi>Majeſties gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning Eccleſiaſtical affairs.</hi> In reference to which we crave leave to add a few words, that thou mayeſt know, that we are none of thoſe who deſire it may not paſs into an <hi>Act,</hi> or think our ſelves by the <hi>Covenant obliged to hinder</hi> ſo good a work.</p>
               <p>The Covenant obligeth us in our callings to endeavour a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2. To endeavour the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Popery, Prelacy, i.e.</hi> The Church-government by <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Archdeacons, Deans, Prebends, Chancellors, Commiſſaries.</hi> We ſuppoſe none dreams us to have covenanted againſt <hi>names,</hi> but <hi>things, viz.</hi> exorbitances of power either <hi>practiſed</hi> by theſe men, or <hi>with</hi> which they were <hi>inveſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two things in point of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> wherein, as to <hi>practice at leaſt,</hi> the Adminiſtration of <hi>Church-Government</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> was heretofore apparently againſt. Gods Word; a third, wherein it was againſt <hi>right reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt was, <hi>That perſons, not ordained, were truſted with the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> viz. <hi>Excommunication,</hi> &amp;c. Such were <hi>Chancellours, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond was, That Prelates <hi>arrogated a ſole power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> both in <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>in the Exerciſe of Juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That which was againſt <hi>Reaſon and Conſcience</hi> was, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> charge was ſuch as an Angel from heaven could not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>In matter of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> two things call'd for Reformation: 1. <hi>The frame of the Lyturgie,</hi> againſt which there were ſufficient exceptions. 2. The <hi>impoſed Ceremonies,</hi> thoſe we mean which were <hi>myſtical</hi> and <hi>Sacramental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far his <hi>moſt Excellent Majeſty</hi> hath taken care in theſe things
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114690:57"/> is now evident to all; and we are moſt humbly thankful to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> for his endeavours in it, and to our Brethren, for their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> relating to it; what his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done, is a great evidence to us, that if hereafter it ſhall be made appear to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that ought yet remains to be farther done, in order to the fulfilling of the Ends of the Covenant, He who (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Circumſtances) hath freely and <hi>honourably</hi> done this, will not be wanting to it, and we are not ſo haſty, as to think <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> can be built in a day. The God of Heaven requite into His <hi>Majeſties</hi> boſome a thouſand fold that love and tenderneſs to His People which He hath in this ſhewed; and we are fully aſſured, that it will be no grief of heart to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> that He hath thus far condeſcended.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> we profeſs our ſelves not againſt a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;</hi> and we doubt not but His <hi>Majeſty</hi> will appoint ſuch perſons to review our <hi>Lyturgie</hi> as will agree in one, which ſhall not be liable to juſt exceptions; till that time His <hi>Majeſty</hi> grants a liberty.</p>
               <p>But we can never be ſufficiently thankful for the liberty His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath granted us, in reference to the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience, Subſcription,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though indeed, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath been pleaſed to deny ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this liberty to <hi>Cathedralls,</hi> and to <hi>Colledges;</hi> yet we doubt not, but when His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhall truly underſtand, that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in both thoſe places, makes the generality of ſober and conſciencious people never come at <hi>Cathedral</hi> Churches, to attend the devotion which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath there provided dayly for them, and that were they abated, and, the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Prebends</hi> enjoyned, in perſon, there to <hi>Expound Scripture, Preach, or Catechize,</hi> or <hi>read Divinity Lectures</hi> there daily, inſtead of meer doing that which every Child might do at home; and that not by themſelves neither, but oft times by mean perſons of no eſteem with ſober and good people. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> will quickly otherwiſe order things there, and not ſuffer ſo great a part of the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to be conſumed in ſuch a way, as is not like to be much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, while it is ſo little acceptable.</p>
               <p>And when His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhall truly underſtand, by His faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, that the retaining the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Colledges</hi> makes many ſober, learned, and conſciencious young men leave the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> (at furtheſt, as ſoon as they can but get a degree) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of His Subjects reſolve againſt breeding their Children there, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114690:57"/> not thinking thoſe Ceremonies lawful; His <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> who hath thus far expreſſed ſo great a tenderneſs to his People, will (as to theſe reſerved Caſes) alſo further provide for them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, though we muſt ſome of us profeſs our ſelves to be of the number of thoſe who dare not ſubmit our Children to an Education in our Univerſities (under thoſe circumſtances) yet we humbly ſubmit to his <hi>Majesties</hi> pleaſure: So we may ſit in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and worſhip God in peace according to his Will; we ſhall be content to purchaſe that our liberty with the denial of our Children the liberty of ingenuous breeding, or at leaſt paying for it in ſome other places: hoping that his <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> will in time alſo take this thing into his mature deliberation.</p>
               <p>But we muſt profeſs, that if <hi>His moſt excellent Majeſties gracious Declaration</hi> had in every tittle fully anſwered the utmoſt of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we ſhould have yet ſeen a need of ſome ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe are for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To recover to our <hi>God</hi> the due <hi>Reverence</hi> which the World hath had, and ought to have for <hi>his Sacred Name:</hi> The Violation of Oaths is in Scripture called, <hi>A prophaning of the Name of the Lord,</hi> Num. 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the World may know, that all the <hi>Divines</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are not ſo meanly verſed in <hi>Divinity,</hi> as to <hi>aſſert,</hi> or <hi>believe,</hi> thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, concerning the diſſolving the <hi>bonds of Oaths,</hi> which ſome have lately vented amongſt us, and are, we are ſure, to be juſtified by no <hi>Father, School-man, Caſuiſt,</hi> or <hi>Textuary,</hi> that ever we heard of in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the ſecurity of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and all <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Christian Magiſtrates;</hi> for we believe, that it will be evident to all that duly conſider it, that <hi>promiſory Oaths</hi> from their Subjects will be of little uſe to eſtabliſh their Thrones, if once their People believe, that they are diſcharged from their Oaths, 1. If their Oaths were againſt <hi>The Laws of the Church:</hi> Or 2. <hi>If they hinder greater good:</hi> Or 3. If they ſware <hi>through fear</hi> of loſing their Eſtates, elſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, 4. <hi>For an evil end:</hi> Or 5. <hi>That the ſame Power, or a greater than that which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſwear, can in all Caſes diſcharge them.</hi> The Papiſt ſhall be free from the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> by <hi>Principle,</hi> becauſe againſt the Laws of his Church; and as ſoon as ſeditious Subjects can but perſwade themſelves, that a <hi>greater good</hi> will come by <hi>Rebellion</hi> than by <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and that the maintaining of a <hi>Monarchical Government</hi> is <hi>finis turpis;</hi> he ſhall plead, his Oath of Allegiance was <hi>a forced Oath,</hi> and there's an end of his duty, and his erroneous practice is juſtified by theſe erroneous Principles.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114690:58"/>4. Finally, (to ſay nothing of the Vindication of our ſelves from our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> reproaches) <hi>for the maintaining of humane Society,</hi> and keeping the bonds of <hi>truth</hi> between man and man in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtrength; Of what uſe (as to this) <hi>aſſertory and promiſory Oaths</hi> are, every one knows: and we leave it to every reaſonable Chriſtian to judge of how little uſe they will be found to be if theſe Principles be once throughly drank in.</p>
               <p>We ſhall only add, that ſince we read his <hi>Majeſties Declaration</hi> we are troubled that we have had any occaſion ſo much as to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>His Majeſties Declaration in Scotland,</hi> (though it was never in our ſecret thoughts to do it with any reflection upon his <hi>Majeſty,</hi>) the ſheets being ſome of them printed, we could not blot out what was written; what is ſaid was in the ſimplicity of our hearts.</p>
               <p>That paper was commonly expoſed to ſale, without any check; as we knew not the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> firſt <hi>ſigning</hi> it, ſo neither knew we of the Printing of it, nor any thing, but that it was free for any to <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>read</hi> it; We are of the number of thoſe (we confeſs) who cannon think our conſciences diſcharged from the <hi>Covenant;</hi> Our Brethren, who have undertaken to abſolve us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually alledge, that the <hi>Covenant,</hi> being taken without his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi> conſent, is <hi>void.</hi> There is a great ſhew in this Argument, if 1. <hi>The Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament have not a power in any caſes to require an Oath upon people,</hi> except 2. <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> or his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> (at <hi>firſt diſſenting) did not afterwards conſent.</hi> In either of theſe Caſes our Brethren know that Argument is of no value. We (not knowing the powers and priviledges of <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor willing to diſpute them; though to engage us to ſwear we were told they had ſuch a power) were not willing to inſiſt upon that Plea, (which muſt be made good by Preſidents, or Law principles, not proper for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) and therefore choſe to mention the latter as ſufficient to enervate that Argument, (for our Brethren, whatever they ſay, will not ſtand to juſtifie, that <hi>Juramentum metu extortum non obligat;</hi>) we heartily wiſh our Brethren would inſiſt upon that Plea no more, they know they have a full anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>Having (good Reader!) thus far advertized thee, we have nothing to ſay, but only to pray, that <hi>God would give thee a good underſtanding in all things,</hi> and <hi>keep thee</hi> in awe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> as knowing that when once (as to the Religion of them) thou haſt got a maſtery over thy Conſcience, nothing will remain ſacred to thee, and the ſtrongeſt ligament of humane Society is broken; And this we dare aver,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114690:58"/> 
                  <hi>That he who feareth not an Oath, but can take every ſlight pretence to quit himſelf of the bond of it, can neither be a good Servant to God, nor a good Subject to his Prince, nor a good man to his Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed therefore is he who feareth alwaies,</hi> though <hi>the ſimple paſs on, and are puniſhed.</hi>
